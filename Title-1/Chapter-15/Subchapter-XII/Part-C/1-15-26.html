In addition, the Council of the District of Columbia, in its consideration of the FY 1994 Appropriated Budget, abolished both agencies and transferred certain responsibilities and positions to the Office of Economic Development (OED).</span>

I have determined that both offices have so similar operational responsibilities that the District would be best served by a unified administration. Not only will this change clarify administrative roles and responsibilities, but it will also provide a sharper focus to the District&#39;s economic development efforts with the private business sector.</span>

The centralization of these activities will diminish fragmented, disjointed, and duplicated service delivery and thus, allow the District to promote its marketing campaign and business services more efficiently and cost-effectively.</span>
