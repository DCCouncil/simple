                    <span class="" style="">This Administration has for some time recognized that the labor-related programs and services in the District of Columbia have been organizationally scattered and fragmented. In the past, several administrative initiatives were undertaken to unite major labor elements but these efforts were frustrated principally because a major organizational component was by law a Federal agency. This impediment was eliminated with the passage of &quot;The Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act&quot; which specifically provided for the transfer of the D.C. Manpower Administration from the United States Department of Labor to the District of Columbia Government. As a result of this new opportunity, I appointed a select executive Task Force on Labor, chaired by the City Administrator, to recommend to me a design for a District of Columbia Department of Labor with the objective of consolidating in this new Department the responsibilities for the major labor-related programs and services provided by this Government.</span>
