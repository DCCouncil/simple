Upon receipt of a written offer of sale from the owner that includes a description of the tenant&#39;s rights and obligations under this section, a group of tenants acting jointly shall have 15 days to provide the owner and the Mayor with a written statement of interest. Following that time period, if the tenants acting jointly have failed to submit a written statement of interest, an individual tenant shall have 7 days to provide a statement of interest to the owner and the Mayor.
