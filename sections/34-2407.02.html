The Mayor may enforce the lien, plus penalties, interest, and administrative costs, in accordance with the provisions for the sale of property for delinquent real property taxes under Chapter 13A of Title 47 if any water and sanitary sewer service charges remain unpaid upon the later of 181 days after the date the bill is rendered or 16 days after a final decision of an appeal challenging the bill. If an accounting is made in accordance with, and subject to, <a href='/dccode/sections/47-1340.html'>§ 47-1340(f)</a>, proceeds from the sale that represent unpaid water charges shall be credited to the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund of the District of Columbia as established by <a href='/dccode/sections/47-375.html'>§ 47-375(g)</a>.&quot;</span>
