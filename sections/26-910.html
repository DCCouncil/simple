Any such person or legal entity which fails to appoint and maintain at all times in the District of Columbia such resident agent shall not, while such failure continues, be entitled to the exemption provided in this section. Whenever any such person or entity does not have in the District of Columbia an agent for service of process or such agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at his registered address, then the said Mayor or his designee shall be the agent for the service of process for such person or entity. Service of process on the Mayor or his designee shall be made by delivering to, and leaving with him, or with any person having charge of his office, or with his designee, duplicate copies of the process accompanied by a fee in the amount of $2 and such service shall be sufficient service upon such person or entity. In the event of such service, the Mayor, or his designee, shall immediately cause one of such copies to be forwarded by registered or certified mail, addressed to such person or entity at his or its address, as such address appears on the records of the Mayor or his designee. Any such service shall be returnable in not less than 30 days unless the rules of the court issuing such process prescribe another period, in which case such prescribed period shall govern. Nothing contained in this section shall limit or affect the right to serve any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on any such person or entity in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law.</span>

Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, <a href='http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=statute&volume=87&page=818'>87 Stat. 818</a>, § 711 (D.C. Code, <a href='/simple/sections/1-207.11.html'>§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, <a href='/simple/sections/1-207.14.html'>§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</span>
