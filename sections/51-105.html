Service of such process shall be made by leaving a copy thereof (with a fee of $2) in the hands of the Director of the Department of Transportation of the District of Columbia, or other persons in charge of his office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon such nonresident; provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the process are forthwith sent, by registered mail, by the plaintiff to the defendant and the defendant&#39;s return receipt attached to the writ and entered with the initial pleading. The court in which the action is pending may order such extensions as may be necessary to afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to defend the action, and no judgment by default in any such action shall be granted until at least 20 days shall have elapsed after the notice of such service has been sent to the defendant as hereinabove prescribed.</span>

Organization Order No. 105 continued the Department of Vehicles and Traffic and prescribed the functions thereof. The Department of Vehicles and Traffic was redesignated as the Department of Motor Vehicles by Commissioners&#39; Order No. 58-919, dated June 10, 1958. The Department of Highways was replaced by Reorganization Order No. 58-1116, dated July 15, 1958, which Order established the Department of Highways and Traffic.
