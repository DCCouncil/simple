A beneficiary&#39;s bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary&#39;s bank and the originator&#39;s bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary&#39;s bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted.

If the beneficiary&#39;s bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary&#39;s bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary&#39;s bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under § 28:4A-406, and (iv) subject to § 28:4A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under § 28:4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.</span>
