A health maintenance organization which fails to pay an assessment within 30 days after notice is subject to a civil forfeiture of not more than $1,000 per day or suspension or revocation of its certificate of authority, or both. Any action taken by the Commissioner in enforcing the provisions of this section may be appealed by the health maintenance organization in accordance with the DCAPA.</span>
