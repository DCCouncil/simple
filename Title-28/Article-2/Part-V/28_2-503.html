                    <span class="" style="">1. The major general rules governing the manner of proper or due tender of delivery are gathered in this section. The term &quot;tender&quot; is used in this Article in two different senses. In one sense it refers to &quot;due tender&quot; which contemplates an offer coupled with a present ability to fulfill all the conditions resting on the tendering party and must be followed by actual performance if the other party shows himself ready to proceed. Unless the context unmistakably indicates otherwise this is the meaning of &quot;tender&quot; in this Article and the occasional addition of the word &quot;due&quot; is only for clarity and emphasis. At other times it is used to refer to an offer of goods or documents under a contract as if in fulfillment of its conditions even though there is a defect when measured against the contract obligation. Used in either sense, however, &quot;tender&quot; connotes such performance by the tendering party as puts the other party in default if he fails to proceed in some manner.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. The seller&#39;s general duty to tender and deliver is laid down in Section 2-301 and more particularly in <a href='/dccode/Title-2/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/2-507.html'>Section 2-507</a>. The seller&#39;s right to a receipt if he demands one and receipts are customary is governed by Section 1-205. Subsection (1) of the present section proceeds to set forth two primary requirements of tender: first, that the seller &quot;put and hold conforming goods at the buyer&#39;s disposition&quot; and, second, that he &quot;give the buyer any notice reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.&quot;</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">In cases in which payment is due and demanded upon delivery the &quot;buyer&#39;s disposition&quot; is qualified by the seller&#39;s right to retain control of the goods until payment by the provision of this Article on delivery on condition. However, where the seller is demanding payment on delivery he must first allow the buyer to inspect the goods in order to avoid impairing his tender unless the contract for sale is on C.I.F., C.O.D., cash against documents or similar terms negating the privilege of inspection before payment.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In the case of contracts involving documents the seller can &quot;put and hold conforming goods at the buyer&#39;s disposition&quot; under subsection (1) by tendering documents which give the buyer complete control of the goods under the provisions of Article 7 on due negotiation.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) there is omitted from this Article the rule under prior uniform legislation that a term requiring the seller to pay the freight or cost of transportation to the buyer is equivalent to an agreement by the seller to deliver to the buyer or at an agreed destination. This omission is with the specific intention of negating the rule, for under this Article the &quot;shipment&quot; contract is regarded as the normal one and the &quot;destination&quot; contract as the variant type. The seller is not obligated to deliver at a named destination and bear the concurrent risk of loss until arrival, unless he has specifically agreed so to deliver or the commercial understanding of the terms used by the parties contemplates such delivery.</span>

Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) adopts the rule that between the buyer and the seller the risk of loss remains on the seller during a period reasonable for securing acknowledgment of the transfer from the bailee, while as against all other parties the buyer&#39;s rights are fixed as of the time the bailee receives notice of the transfer.</span>

Under subsection (5) documents are never &quot;required&quot; except where there is an express contract term or it is plainly implicit in the peculiar circumstances of the case or in a usage of trade. Documents may, of course, be &quot;authorized&quot; although not required, but such cases are not within the scope of this subsection. When documents are required, there are three main requirements of this subsection: (1) &quot;All&quot;: each required document is essential to a proper tender; (2) &quot;Such&quot;: the documents must be the ones actually required by the contract in terms of source and substance; (3) &quot;Correct form&quot;: All documents must be in correct form.</span>
