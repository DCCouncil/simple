                    <span class="" style="">1. Whether or not this warranty arises in any individual case is basically a question of fact to be determined by the circumstances of the contracting. Under this section the buyer need not bring home to the seller actual knowledge of the particular purpose for which the goods are intended or of his reliance on the seller&#39;s skill and judgment, if the circumstances are such that the seller has reason to realize the purpose intended or that the reliance exists. The buyer, of course, must actually be relying on the seller.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">2. A &quot;particular purpose&quot; differs from the ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it envisages a specific use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business whereas the ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envisaged in the concept of merchantability and go to uses which are customarily made of the goods in question. For example, shoes are generally used for the purpose of walking upon ordinary ground, but a seller may know that a particular pair was selected to be used for climbing mountains.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">A contract may of course include both a warranty of merchantability and one of fitness for a particular purpose.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">The provisions of this Article on the cumulation and conflict of express and implied warranties must be considered on the question of inconsistency between or among warranties. In such a case any question of fact as to which warranty was intended by the parties to apply must be resolved in favor of the warranty of fitness for particular purpose as against all other warranties except where the buyer has taken upon himself the responsibility of furnishing the technical specifications.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. In connection with the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose the provisions of this Article on the allocation or division of risks are particularly applicable in any transaction in which the purpose for which the goods are to be used combines requirements both as to the quality of the goods themselves and compliance with certain laws or regulations. How the risks are divided is a question of fact to be determined, where not expressly contained in the agreement, from the circumstances of contracting, usage of trade, course of performance and the like, matters which may constitute the &quot;otherwise agreement&quot; of the parties by which they may divide the risk or burden.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. The absence from this section of the language used in the Uniform Sales Act in referring to the seller, &quot;whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not,&quot; is not intended to impose any requirement that the seller be a grower or manufacturer. Although normally the warranty will arise only where the seller is a merchant with the appropriate &quot;skill or judgment,&quot; it can arise as to nonmerchants where this is justified by the particular circumstances.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">5. The elimination of the &quot;patent or other trade name&quot; exception constitutes the major extension of the warranty of fitness which has been made by the cases and continued in this Article. Under the present section the existence of a patent or other trade name and the designation of the article by that name, or indeed in any other definite manner, is only one of the facts to be considered on the question of whether the buyer actually relied on the seller, but it is not of itself decisive of the issue. If the buyer himself is insisting on a particular brand he is not relying on the seller&#39;s skill and judgment and so no warranty results. But the mere fact that the article purchased has a particular patent or trade name is not sufficient to indicate nonreliance if the article has been recommended by the seller as adequate for the buyer&#39;s purposes.</span>
                
            
        </p>

                    <span class="" style="">6. The specific reference forward in the present section to the following section on exclusion or modification of warranties is to call attention to the possibility of eliminating the warranty in any given case. However it must be noted that under the following section the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose must be excluded or modified by a conspicuous writing.</span>
