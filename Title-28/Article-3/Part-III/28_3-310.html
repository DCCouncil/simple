As a practical matter, application of former Section 3-802 was limited to cases in which a check or a note was given for an obligation. Subsections (a) and (b) of <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-310.html'>Section 3-310</a> are therefore stated in terms of checks and notes in the interests of clarity. Subsection (c) covers the rare cases in which some other instrument is given to pay an obligation.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (a) deals with the case in which a certified check, cashier&#39;s check or teller&#39;s check is given in payment of an obligation. In that case the obligation is discharged unless there is an agreement to the contrary. Subsection (a) drops the exception in former Section 3-802 for cases in which there is a right of recourse on the instrument against the obligor. Under former Section 3-802(1)(a) the obligation was not discharged if there was a right of recourse on the instrument against the obligor. Subsection (a) changes this result. The underlying obligation is discharged, but any right of recourse on the instrument is preserved.</span>
                
            
        </p>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (b) concerns cases in which an uncertified check or a note is taken for an obligation. The typical case is that in which a buyer pays for goods or services by giving the seller the buyer&#39;s personal check, or in which the buyer signs a note for the purchase price. Subsection (b) also applies to the uncommon cases in which a check or note of a third person is given in payment of the obligation. Subsection (b) preserves the rule under former Section 3-802(1)(b) that the buyer&#39;s obligation to pay the price is suspended, but subsection (b) spells out the effect more precisely. If the check or note is dishonored, the seller may sue on either the dishonored instrument or the contract of sale if the seller has possession of the instrument and is the person entitled to enforce it. If the right to enforce the instrument is held by somebody other than the seller, the seller can&#39;t enforce the right to payment of the price under the sales contract because that right is represented by the instrument which is enforceable by somebody else. Thus, if the seller sold the note or the check to a holder and has not reacquired it after dishonor, the only right that survives is the right to enforce the instrument.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The last sentence of subsection (b)(3) applies to cases in which an instrument of another person is indorsed over to the obligee in payment of the obligation. For example, Buyer delivers an uncertified personal check of X payable to the order of Buyer to Seller in payment of the price of goods. Buyer indorses the check over to Seller. Buyer is liable on the check as indorser. If Seller neglects to present the check for payment or to deposit it for collection within 30 days of the indorsement, Buyer&#39;s liability as indorser is discharged. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-415.html'>Section 3-415(e)</a>. Under the last sentence of <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-310.html'>Section 3-310(b)(3)</a> Buyer is also discharged on the obligation to pay for the goods.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. There was uncertainty concerning the applicability of former Section 3-802 to the case in which the check given for the obligation was stolen from the payee, the payee&#39;s signature was forged, and the forger obtained payment. The last sentence of subsection (b)(4) addresses this issue. If the payor bank pays a holder, the drawer is discharged on the underlying obligation because the check was paid. Subsection (b)(1). If the payor bank pays a person not entitled to enforce the instrument, as in the hypothetical case, the suspension of the underlying obligation continues because the check has not been paid. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-6/3-602.html'>Section 3-602(a)</a>. The payee&#39;s cause of action is against the depositary bank or payor bank in conversion under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-420.html'>Section 3-420</a> or against the drawer under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-309~P.html'>Section 3-309</a>. In the latter case, the drawer&#39;s obligation under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-414.html'>Section 3-414(b)</a> is triggered by dishonor which occurs because the check is unpaid. Presentment for payment to the drawee is excused under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-504.html'>Section 3-504(a)(i)</a> and, under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-502.html'>Section 3-502(e)</a>, dishonor occurs without presentment if the check is not paid. The payee cannot merely ignore the instrument and sue the drawer on the underlying contract. This would impose on the drawer the risk that the check when stolen was indorsed in blank or to bearer.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">A similar analysis applies with respect to lost instruments that have not been paid. If a creditor takes a check of the debtor in payment of an obligation, the obligation is suspended under the introductory paragraph of subsection (b). If the creditor then loses the check, what are the creditor&#39;s rights? The creditor can request the debtor to issue a new check and in many cases, the debtor will issue a replacement check after stopping payment on the lost check. In that case both the debtor and creditor are protected. But the debtor is not obliged to issue a new check. If the debtor refuses to issue a replacement check, the last sentence of subsection (b)(4) applies. The creditor may not enforce the obligation of debtor for which the check was taken. The creditor may assert only rights on the check. The creditor can proceed under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-309~P.html'>Section 3-309</a> to enforce the obligation of the debtor, as drawer, to pay the check.</span>

If a bank is the obligor on the instrument, subsection (a) applies and the obligation is discharged. In any other case subsection (b) applies.</span>
