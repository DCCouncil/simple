                    <span class="" style="">1. Subsection (a) is a restatement of former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303</a> and subsection (b) replaces former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-408.html'>Section 3-408</a>. The distinction between value and consideration in Article 3 is a very fine one. Whether an instrument is taken for value is relevant to the issue of whether a holder is a holder in due course. If an instrument is not issued for consideration the issuer has a defense to the obligation to pay the instrument. Consideration is defined in subsection (b) as &quot;any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.&quot; The definition of value in Section 1-201(44), which doesn&#39;t apply to Article 3, includes &quot;any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.&quot; Thus, outside Article 3, anything that is consideration is also value. A different rule applies in Article 3. Subsection (b) of <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303</a> states that if an instrument is issued for value it is also issued for consideration.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (a), which defines value, has primary importance in cases in which the issue is whether the holder of an instrument is a holder in due course and particularly to cases in which the issuer of the instrument has a defense to the instrument. Suppose Buyer and Seller signed a contract on April 1 for the sale of goods to be delivered on May 1. Payment of 50% of the price of the goods was due upon signing of the contract. On April 1 Buyer delivered to Seller a check in the amount due under the contract. The check was drawn by X to Buyer as payee and was indorsed to Seller. When the check was presented for payment to the drawee on April 2, it was dishonored because X had stopped payment. At that time Seller had not taken any action to perform the contract with Buyer. If X has a defense on the check, the defense can be asserted against Seller who is not a holder in due course because Seller did not give value for the check. Subsection (a)(1). The policy basis for subsection (a)(1) is that the holder who gives an executory promise of performance will not suffer an out-of-pocket loss to the extent the executory promise is unperformed at the time the holder learns of dishonor of the instrument. When Seller took delivery of the check on April 1, Buyer&#39;s obligation to pay 50% of the price on that date was suspended, but when the check was dishonored on April 2 the obligation revived. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-310.html'>Section 3-310(b)</a>. If payment for goods is due at or before delivery and the Buyer fails to make the payment, the Seller is excused from performing the promise to deliver the goods. <a href='/dccode/Title-2/Chapter-7/2-703.html'>Section 2-703</a>. Thus, Seller is protected from an out-of-pocket loss even if the check is not enforceable. Holder-in-due-course status is not necessary to protect Seller.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (a)(2) equates value with the obtaining of a security interest or a nonjudicial lien in the instrument. The term &quot;security interest&quot; covers Article 9 cases in which an instrument is taken as collateral as well as bank collection cases in which a bank acquires a security interest under Section 4-210. The acquisition of a common-law or statutory banker&#39;s lien is also value under subsection (a)(2). An attaching creditor or other person who acquires a lien by judicial proceedings does not give value for the purposes of subsection (a)(2).</span>

Subsection (a)(3) follows former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303(b)</a> in providing that the holder takes for value if the instrument is taken in payment of or as security for an antecedent claim, even though there is no extension of time or other concession, and whether or not the claim is due. Subsection (a)(3) applies to any claim against any person; there is no requirement that the claim arise out of contract. In particular the provision is intended to apply to an instrument given in payment of or as security for the debt of a third person, even though no concession is made in return.</span>
