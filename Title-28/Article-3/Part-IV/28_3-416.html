                    <span class="" style="">1. Subsection (a) is taken from subsection (2) of former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417</a>. Subsections (3) and (4) of former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417</a> are deleted. Warranties under subsection (a) in favor of the immediate transferee apply to all persons who transfer an instrument for consideration whether or not the transfer is accompanied by indorsement. Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract will support those warranties. If there is an indorsement the warranty runs with the instrument and the remote holder may sue the indorser-warrantor directly and thus avoid a multiplicity of suits.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">2. Since the purpose of transfer (<a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-2/3-203.html'>Section 3-203(a)</a>) is to give the transferee the right to enforce the instrument, subsection (a)(1) is a warranty that the transferor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument (<a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-301.html'>Section 3-301</a>). Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-2/3-203.html'>Section 3-203(b)</a> transfer gives the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument. Subsection (a)(1) is in effect a warranty that there are no unauthorized or missing indorsements that prevent the transferor from making the transferee a person entitled to enforce the instrument.</span>
                
            
        </p>

                    <span class="" style="">3. The rationale of subsection (a)(4) is that the transferee does not undertake to buy an instrument that is not enforceable in whole or in part, unless there is a contrary agreement. Even if the transferee takes as a holder in due course who takes free of the defense or claim in recoupment, the warranty gives the transferee the option of proceeding against the transferor rather than litigating with the obligor on the instrument the issue of the holder-in-due-course status of the transferee. Subsection (3) of former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417</a> which limits this warranty is deleted. The rationale is that while the purpose of a &quot;no recourse&quot; indorsement is to avoid a guaranty of payment, the indorsement does not clearly indicate an intent to disclaim warranties.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">4. Under subsection (a)(5) the transferor does not warrant against difficulties of collection, impairment of the credit of the obligor or even insolvency. The transferee is expected to determine such questions before taking the obligation. If insolvency proceedings as defined in Section 1-201(22) have been instituted against the party who is expected to pay and the transferor knows it, the concealment of that fact amounts to a fraud upon the transferee, and the warranty against knowledge of such proceedings is provided accordingly.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Transfer warranties may be disclaimed with respect to any instrument except a check. Between the immediate parties disclaimer may be made by agreement. In the case of an indorser, disclaimer of transferor&#39;s liability, to be effective, must appear in the indorsement with words such as &quot;without warranties&quot; or some other specific reference to warranties. But in the case of a check, subsection (c) of <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-416.html'>Section 3-416</a> provides that transfer warranties cannot be disclaimed at all. In the check collection process the banking system relies on these warranties.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Subsection (b) states the measure of damages for breach of warranty. There is no express provision for attorney&#39;s fees, but attorney&#39;s fees are not meant to be necessarily excluded. They could be granted because they fit within the phrase &quot;expenses * * * incurred as a result of the breach.&quot; The intention is to leave to other state law the issue as to when attorney&#39;s fees are recoverable.</span>

Since the traditional term &quot;cause of action&quot; may have been replaced in some states by &quot;claim for relief&quot; or some equivalent term, the words &quot;cause of action&quot; in subsection (d) have been bracketed to indicate that the words may be replaced by an appropriate substitute to conform to local practice.</span>
