The former provision was difficult to understand because it purported to state in one subsection all warranties given to any person paying any instrument. The result was a provision replete with exceptions that could not be readily understood except after close scrutiny of the language. In revised <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417</a>, presentment warranties made to drawees of uncertified checks and other unaccepted drafts are stated in subsection (a). All other presentment warranties are stated in subsection (d).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (a) states three warranties. Subsection (a)(1) in effect is a warranty that there are no unauthorized or missing indorsements. &quot;Person entitled to enforce&quot; is defined in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-301.html'>Section 3-301</a>. Subsection (a)(2) is a warranty that there is no alteration. Subsection (a)(3) is a warranty of no knowledge that there is a forged drawer&#39;s signature. Subsection (a) states that the warranties are made to the drawee and subsections (b) and (c) identify the drawee as the person entitled to recover for breach of warranty. There is no warranty made to the drawer under subsection (a) when presentment is made to the drawee. Warranty to the drawer is governed by subsection (d) and that applies only when presentment for payment is made to the drawer with respect to a dishonored draft. In Sun &#39;N Sand, Inc. v. United California Bank, 582 P.2d 920 (Cal.1978), the court held that under former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417(1)</a> a warranty was made to the drawer of a check when the check was presented to the drawee for payment. The result in that case is rejected.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (a)(1) retains the rule that the drawee does not admit the authenticity of indorsements and subsection (a)(3) retains the rule of Price v. Neal, 3 Burr. 1354 (1762), that the drawee takes the risk that the drawer&#39;s signature is unauthorized unless the person presenting the draft has knowledge that the drawer&#39;s signature is unauthorized. Under subsection (a)(3) the warranty of no knowledge that the drawer&#39;s signature is unauthorized is also given by prior transferors of the draft.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Subsection (d) applies to presentment for payment in all cases not covered by subsection (a). It applies to presentment of notes and accepted drafts to any party obliged to pay the instrument, including an indorser, and to presentment of dishonored drafts if made to the drawer or an indorser. In cases covered by subsection (d), there is only one warranty and it is the same as that stated in subsection (a)(1). There are no warranties comparable to subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) because they are appropriate only in the case of presentment to the drawee of an unaccepted draft. With respect to presentment of an accepted draft to the acceptor, there is no warranty with respect to alteration or knowledge that the signature of the drawer is unauthorized. Those warranties were made to the drawee when the draft was presented for acceptance (<a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417(a)(2)</a> and (3)) and breach of that warranty is a defense to the obligation of the drawee as acceptor to pay the draft. If the drawee pays the accepted draft the drawee may recover the payment from any warrantor who was in breach of warranty when the draft was accepted. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417(b)</a>. Thus, there is no necessity for these warranties to be repeated when the accepted draft is presented for payment. Former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417(1)(b)(iii)</a> and (c)(iii) are not included in revised <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417</a> because they are unnecessary. Former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-417.html'>Section 3-417(1)(c)(iv)</a> is not included because it is also unnecessary. The acceptor should know what the terms of the draft were at the time acceptance was made.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">If presentment is made to the drawer or maker, there is no necessity for a warranty concerning the signature of that person or with respect to alteration. If presentment is made to an indorser, the indorser had itself warranted authenticity of signatures and that the instrument was not altered. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-416.html'>Section 3-416(a)(2)</a> and (3).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. The measure of damages for breach of warranty under subsection (a) is stated in subsection (b). There is no express provision for attorney&#39;s fees, but attorney&#39;s fees are not meant to be necessarily excluded. They could be granted because they fit within the language &quot;expenses * * * resulting from the breach.&quot; Subsection (b) provides that the right of the drawee to recover for breach of warranty is not affected by a failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying the draft. This provision follows the result reached under former Article 3 in Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. First Pennsylvania Bank, 859 F.2d 295 (3d Cir.1988).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Subsection (c) applies to checks and other unaccepted drafts. It gives to the warrantor the benefit of rights that the drawee has against the drawer under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-404.html'>Section 3-404</a>, 3-405, 3-406, or 4-406. If the drawer&#39;s conduct contributed to a loss from forgery or alteration, the drawee should not be allowed to shift the loss from the drawer to the warrantor.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. The first sentence of subsection (e) recognizes that checks are normally paid by automated means and that payor banks rely on warranties in making payment. Thus, it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be examined by the payor bank. The second sentence requires a breach of warranty claim to be asserted within 30 days after the drawee learns of the breach and the identity of the warrantor.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">8. Since the traditional term &quot;cause of action&quot; may have been replaced in some states by &quot;claim for relief&quot; or some equivalent term, the words &quot;cause of action&quot; in subsection (f) have been bracketed to indicate that the words may be replaced by an appropriate substitute to conform to local practice.</span>
