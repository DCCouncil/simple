                    <span class="" style="">1. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406(a)</a> is based on former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a>. With respect to alteration, <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> adopts the doctrine of Young v. Grote, 4 Bing. 253 (1827), which held that a drawer who so negligently draws an instrument as to facilitate its material alteration is liable to a drawee who pays the altered instrument in good faith. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> the doctrine is expanded to apply not only to drafts but to all instruments. It includes in the protected class any &quot;person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.&quot; <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> rejects decisions holding that the maker of a note owes no duty of care to the holder because at the time the instrument is issued there is no contract between them. By issuing the instrument and &quot;setting it afloat upon a sea of strangers&quot; the maker or drawer voluntarily enters into a relation with later holders which justifies imposition of a duty of care. In this respect an instrument so negligently drawn as to facilitate alteration does not differ in principle from an instrument containing blanks which may be filled. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-407.html'>Section 3-407</a> a person paying an altered instrument or taking it for value, in good faith and without notice of the alteration may enforce rights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms. If negligence of the obligor substantially contributes to an alteration, this section gives the holder or the payor the alternative right to treat the altered instrument as though it had been issued in the altered form.</span>

The question is left to the court or the jury for decision in the light of the circumstances in the particular case including reasonable commercial standards that may apply.</span>

Unauthorized signature is a broader concept that includes not only forgery but also the signature of an agent which does not bind the principal under the law of agency. The agency cases are resolved independently under agency law. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> is not necessary in those cases.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The &quot;substantially contributes&quot; test of former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> is continued in this section in preference to a &quot;direct and proximate cause&quot; test. The &quot;substantially contributes&quot; test is meant to be less stringent than a &quot;direct and proximate cause&quot; test. Under the less stringent test the preclusion should be easier to establish. Conduct &quot;substantially contributes&quot; to a material alteration or forged signature if it is a contributing cause of the alteration or signature and a substantial factor in bringing it about. The analysis of &quot;substantially contributes&quot; in former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> by the court in Thompson Maple Products v. Citizens National Bank of Corry, 234 A.2d 32 (Pa.Super.Ct.1967), states what is intended by the use of the same words in revised <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406(b)</a>. Since <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-404.html'>Section 3-404(d)</a> and <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-405.html'>Section 3-405(b)</a> also use the words &quot;substantially contributes&quot; the analysis of these words also applies to those provisions.</span>

Employer keeps the rubber stamp along with Employer&#39;s personalized blank check forms in an unlocked desk drawer. An unauthorized person fraudulently uses the check forms to write checks on Employer&#39;s account. The checks are signed by use of the rubber stamp. If Employer demands that Employer&#39;s account in the drawee bank be recredited because the forged check was not properly payable, the drawee bank may defend by asserting that Employer is precluded from asserting the forgery. The trier of fact could find that Employer failed to exercise ordinary care to safeguard the rubber stamp and the check forms and that the failure substantially contributed to the forgery of Employer&#39;s signature by the unauthorized use of the rubber stamp.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #2. An insurance company draws a check to the order of Sarah Smith in payment of a claim of a policyholder, Sarah Smith, who lives in Alabama. The insurance company also has a policyholder with the same name who lives in Illinois. By mistake, the insurance company mails the check to the Illinois Sarah Smith who indorses the check and obtains payment. Because the payee of the check is the Alabama Sarah Smith, the indorsement by the Illinois Sarah Smith is a forged indorsement. Section 3-110(a). The trier of fact could find that the insurance company failed to exercise ordinary care when it mailed the check to the wrong person and that the failure substantially contributed to the making of the forged indorsement. In that event the insurance company could be precluded from asserting the forged indorsement against the drawee bank that honored the check.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #3. A company writes a check for $10. The figure &quot;10&quot; and the word &quot;ten&quot; are typewritten in the appropriate spaces on the check form. A large blank space is left after the figure and the word. The payee of the check, using a typewriter with a typeface similar to that used on the check, writes the word &quot;thousand&quot; after the word &quot;ten&quot; and a comma and three zeros after the figure &quot;10&quot;. The drawee bank in good faith pays $10,000 when the check is presented for payment and debits the account of the drawer in that amount. The trier of fact could find that the drawer failed to exercise ordinary care in writing the check and that the failure substantially contributed to the alteration. In that case the drawer is precluded from asserting the alteration against the drawee if the check was paid in good faith.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Subsection (b) differs from former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> in that it adopts a concept of comparative negligence. If the person precluded under subsection (a) proves that the person asserting the preclusion failed to exercise ordinary care and that failure substantially contributed to the loss, the loss may be allocated between the two parties on a comparative negligence basis. In the case of a forged indorsement the litigation is usually between the payee of the check and the depositary bank that took the check for collection. An example is a case like Case #1 of Comment 3 to <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-405.html'>Section 3-405</a>. If the trier of fact finds that Employer failed to exercise ordinary care in safeguarding the check and that the failure substantially contributed to the making of the forged indorsement, subsection (a) of <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-406.html'>Section 3-406</a> applies. If Employer brings an action for conversion against the depositary bank that took the checks from the forger, the depositary bank could assert the preclusion under subsection (a). But suppose the forger opened an account in the depositary bank in a name identical to that of Employer, the payee of the check, and then deposited the check in the account. Subsection (b) may apply. There may be an issue whether the depositary bank should have been alerted to possible fraud when a new account was opened for a corporation shortly before a very large check payable to a payee with the same name is deposited. Circumstances surrounding the opening of the account may have suggested that the corporation to which the check was payable may not be the same as the corporation for which the account was opened. If the trier of fact finds that collecting the check under these circumstances was a failure to exercise ordinary care, it could allocate the loss between the depositary bank and Employer, the payee.</span>
