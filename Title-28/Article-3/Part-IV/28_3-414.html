It replaces former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-413.html'>Section 3-413(2)</a>. The requirement under former Article 3 of notice of dishonor or protest has been eliminated. Under revised Article 3, notice of dishonor is necessary only with respect to indorser&#39;s liability. The liability of the drawer of an unaccepted draft is treated as a primary liability. Under former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-102.html'>Section 3-102(1)(d)</a> the term &quot;secondary party&quot; was used to refer to a drawer or indorser. The quoted term is not used in revised Article 3. The effect of a draft drawn without recourse is stated in subsection (e).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Under subsection (c) the drawer is discharged of liability on a draft accepted by a bank regardless of when acceptance was obtained. This changes former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-411.html'>Section 3-411(1)</a> which provided that the drawer is discharged only if the holder obtains acceptance.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Subsection (d) states the liability of the drawer if a draft is accepted by a drawee other than a bank and the acceptor dishonors. The drawer of an unaccepted draft is the only party liable on the instrument. The drawee has no liability on the draft. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-408.html'>Section 3-408</a>. When the draft is accepted, the obligations change. The drawee, as acceptor, becomes primarily liable and the drawer&#39;s liability is that of a person secondarily liable as a guarantor of payment. The drawer&#39;s liability is identical to that of an indorser, and subsection (d) states the drawer&#39;s liability that way. The drawer is liable to pay the person entitled to enforce the draft or any indorser that pays pursuant to <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-415.html'>Section 3-415</a>. The drawer in this case is discharged if notice of dishonor is required by <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-503.html'>Section 3-503</a> and is not given in compliance with that section. A drawer that pays has a right of recourse against the acceptor. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-413.html'>Section 3-413(a)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Subsection (e) does not permit the drawer of a check to avoid liability under subsection (b) by drawing the check without recourse. There is no legitimate purpose served by issuing a check on which nobody is liable. Drawing without recourse is effective to disclaim liability of the drawer if the draft is not a check. Suppose, in a documentary sale, Seller draws a draft on Buyer for the price of goods shipped to Buyer. The draft is payable upon delivery to the drawee of an order bill of lading covering the goods. Seller delivers the draft with the bill of lading to Finance Company that is named as payee of the draft. If Seller draws without recourse Finance Company takes the risk that Buyer will dishonor. If Buyer dishonors, Finance Company has no recourse against Seller but it can obtain reimbursement by selling the goods which it controls through the bill of lading.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">6. Subsection (f) is derived from former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-502.html'>Section 3-502(1)(b)</a>. It is designed to protect the drawer of a check against loss resulting from suspension of payments by the drawee bank when the holder of the check delays collection of the check. For example, X writes a check payable to Y for $1,000. The check is covered by funds in X&#39;s account in the drawee bank. Y delays initiation of collection of the check for more than 30 days after the date of the check. The drawee bank suspends payments after the 30-day period and before the check is presented for payment. If the $1,000 of funds in X&#39;s account have not been withdrawn, X has a claim for those funds against the drawee bank and, if subsection (e) were not in effect, X would be liable to Y on the check because the check was dishonored. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-502.html'>Section 3-502(e)</a>. If the suspension of payments by the drawee bank will result in payment to X of less than the full amount of the $1,000 in the account or if there is a significant delay in payment to X, X will suffer a loss which would not have been suffered if Y had promptly initiated collection of the check. In most cases, X will not suffer any loss because of the existence of federal bank deposit insurance that covers accounts up to $100,000. Thus, subsection (e) has relatively little importance. There might be some cases, however, in which the account is not fully insured because it exceeds $100,000 or because the account doesn&#39;t qualify for deposit insurance. Subsection (f) retains the phrase &quot;deprived of funds maintained with the drawee&quot; appearing in former <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-5/Subchapter-I/3-502.html'>Section 3-502(1)(b)</a>. The quoted phrase applies if the suspension of payments by the drawee prevents the drawer from receiving the benefit of funds which would have paid the check if the holder had been timely in initiating collection. Thus, any significant delay in obtaining full payment of the funds is a deprivation of funds. The drawer can discharge drawer&#39;s liability by assigning rights against the drawee with respect to the funds to the holder.</span>
