                    <span class="" style="">1. Section 3-110 states rules for determining the identity of the person to whom an instrument is initially payable if the instrument is payable to an identified person. This issue usually arises in a dispute over the validity of an indorsement in the name of the payee. Subsection (a) states the general rule that the person to whom an instrument is payable is determined by the intent of &quot;the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument.&quot; &quot;Issuer&quot; means the maker or drawer of the instrument. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-105.html'>Section 3-105(c)</a>. If X signs a check as drawer of a check on X&#39;s account, the intent of X controls. If X, as President of Corporation, signs a check as President in behalf of Corporation as drawer, the intent of X controls. If X forges Y&#39;s signature as drawer of a check, the intent of X also controls. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-103.html'>Section 3-103(a)(3)</a>, Y is referred to as the drawer of the check because the signing of Y&#39;s name identifies Y as the drawer. But since Y&#39;s signature was forged Y has no liability as drawer (<a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-403~P.html'>Section 3-403(a)</a>) unless some other provision of Article 3 or Article 4 makes Y liable. Since X, even though unauthorized, signed in the name of Y as issuer, the intent of X determines to whom the check is payable.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">In the case of a check payable to &quot;John Smith,&quot; since there are many people in the world named &quot;John Smith&quot; it is not possible to identify the payee of the check unless there is some further identification or the intention of the drawer is determined. Name alone is sufficient under subsection (a), but the intention of the drawer determines which John Smith is the person to whom the check is payable. The same issue is presented in cases of misdescriptions of the payee. The drawer intends to pay a person known to the drawer as John Smith. In fact that person&#39;s name is James Smith or John Jones or some other entirely different name. If the check identifies the payee as John Smith, it is nevertheless payable to the person intended by the drawer. That person may indorse the check in either the name John Smith or the person&#39;s correct name or in both names. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-2/3-204.html'>Section 3-204(d)</a>. The intent of the drawer is also controlling in fictitious payee cases. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-404.html'>Section 3-404(b)</a>. The last sentence of subsection (a) refers to rare cases in which the signature of an organization requires more than one signature and the persons signing on behalf of the organization do not all intend the same person as payee. Any person intended by a signer for the organization is the payee and an indorsement by that person is an effective indorsement.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (b) recognizes the fact that in a large number of cases there is no human signer of an instrument because the instrument, usually a check, is produced by automated means such as a check-writing machine. In that case, the relevant intent is that of the person who supplied the name of the payee. In most cases that person is an employee of the drawer, but in some cases the person could be an outsider who is committing a fraud by introducing names of payees of checks into the system that produces the checks. A check-writing machine is likely to be operated by means of a computer in which is stored information as to name and address of the payee and the amount of the check. Access to the computer may allow production of fraudulent checks without knowledge of the organization that is the issuer of the check. <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-404.html'>Section 3-404(b)</a> is also concerned with this issue. See Case #4 in Comment 2 to <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-404.html'>Section 3-404</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (c) allows the payee to be identified in any way including the various ways stated. Subsection (c)(1) relates to instruments payable to bank accounts. In some cases the account might be identified by name and number, and the name and number might refer to different persons. For example, a check is payable to &quot;X Corporation Account No. 12345 in Bank of Podunk.&quot; Under the last sentence of subsection (c)(1), this check is payable to X Corporation and can be negotiated by X Corporation even if Account No. 12345 is some other person&#39;s account or the check is not deposited in that account. In other cases the payee is identified by an account number and the name of the owner of the account is not stated. For example, Debtor pays Creditor by issuing a check drawn on Payor Bank. The check is payable to a bank account owned by Creditor but identified only by number. Under the first sentence of subsection (c)(1) the check is payable to Creditor and, under Section 1-201(20), Creditor becomes the holder when the check is delivered. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-2/3-201.html'>Section 3-201(b)</a>, further negotiation of the check requires the indorsement of Creditor.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">But under Section 4-205(a), if the check is taken by a depositary bank for collection, the bank may become a holder without the indorsement. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-102.html'>Section 3-102(b)</a>, provisions of Article 4 prevail over those of Article 3. The depositary bank warrants that the amount of the check was credited to the payee&#39;s account.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (c)(2) replaces former Section 3-117 and subsection (1)(e), (f), and (g) of former Section 3-110. This provision merely determines who can deal with an instrument as a holder. It does not determine ownership of the instrument or its proceeds. Subsection (c)(2)(i) covers trusts and estates. If the instrument is payable to the trust or estate or to the trustee or representative of the trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee or representative or any successor. Under subsection (c)(2)(ii), if the instrument states that it is payable to Doe, President of X Corporation, either Doe or X Corporation can be holder of the instrument. Subsection (c)(2)(iii) concerns informal organizations that are not legal entities such as unincorporated clubs and the like. Any representative of the members of the organization can act as holder. Subsection (c)(2)(iv) applies principally to instruments payable to public offices such as a check payable to County Tax Collector.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Subsection (d) replaces former Section 3-116. An instrument payable to X or Y is governed by the first sentence of subsection (d). An instrument payable to X and Y is governed by the second sentence of subsection (d). If an instrument is payable to X or Y, either is the payee and if either is in possession that person is the holder and the person entitled to enforce the instrument.</span>

                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-301.html'>Section 3-301</a>. If an instrument is payable to X and Y, neither X nor Y acting alone is the person to whom the instrument is payable. Neither person, acting alone, can be the holder of the instrument. The instrument is &quot;payable to an identified person.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The &quot;identified person&quot; is X and Y acting jointly. Section 3-109(b) and <a href='/dccode/Title-1/Chapter-1/Subchapter-I/1-102.html'>Section 1-102(5)(a)</a>. Thus, under Section 1-201(20) X or Y, acting alone, cannot be the holder or the person entitled to enforce or negotiate the instrument because neither, acting alone, is the identified person stated in the instrument.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The third sentence of subsection (d) is directed to cases in which it is not clear whether an instrument is payable to multiple payees alternatively. In the case of ambiguity persons dealing with the instrument should be able to rely on the indorsement of a single payee. For example, an instrument payable to X and/or Y is treated like an instrument payable to X or Y.</span>
