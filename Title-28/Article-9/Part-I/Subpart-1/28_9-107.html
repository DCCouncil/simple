                    <span class="" style="">2. &quot;Control&quot; of Letter-of-Credit Right. Whether a secured party has control of a letter-of-credit right may determine the secured party&#39;s priority as against competing secured parties. See Section 9-329. This section provides that a secured party acquires control of a letter-of-credit right by receiving an assignment if the secured party obtains the consent of the issuer or any nominated person, such as a confirmer or negotiating bank, under Section 5-114 or other applicable law or practice. Because both issuers and nominated persons may give or be obligated to give value under a letter of credit, this section contemplates that a secured party obtains control of a letter-of-credit right with respect to the issuer or a particular nominated person only to the extent that the issuer or that nominated person consents to the assignment. For example, if a secured party obtains control to the extent of an issuer&#39;s obligation but fails to obtain the consent of a nominated person, the secured party does not have control to the extent that the nominated person gives value. In many cases the person or persons who will give value under a letter of credit will be clear from its terms. In other cases, prudence may suggest obtaining consent from more than one person. The details of the consenting issuer&#39;s or nominated person&#39;s duties to pay or otherwise render performance to the secured party are left to the agreement of the parties.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. &quot;Proceeds of a Letter of Credit.&quot; Section 5-114 follows traditional banking terminology by referring to a letter of credit beneficiary&#39;s assignment of its right to receive payment thereunder as an assignment of the &quot;proceeds of a letter of credit.&quot; However, as the seller of goods can assign its right to receive payment (an &quot;account&quot;) before it has been earned by delivering the goods to the buyer, so the beneficiary of a letter of credit can assign its contingent right to payment before the letter of credit has been honored. See Section 5-114(b). If the assignment creates a security interest, the security interest can be perfected at the time it is created. An assignment of, including the creation of a security interest in, a letter-of-credit right is an assignment of a present interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. &quot;Transfer&quot; vs. &quot;Assignment.&quot; Letter-of-credit law and practice distinguish the &quot;transfer&quot; of a letter of credit from an &quot;assignment.&quot; Under a transfer, the transferee itself becomes the beneficiary and acquires the right to draw. Whether a new, substitute credit is issued or the issuer advises the transferee of its status as such, the transfer constitutes a novation under which the transferee is the new, substituted beneficiary (but only to the extent of the transfer, in the case of a partial transfer).</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Section 5-114(e) provides that the rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary&#39;s assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee&#39;s right to the proceeds. For this reason, transfer does not appear in this Article as a means of control or perfection. Section 9-109(c)(4) recognizes the independent and superior rights of a transferee beneficiary under Section 5-114(e); this Article does not apply to the rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person to the extent that those rights are independent and superior under Section 5-114.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Supporting Obligation: Automatic Attachment and Perfection. A letter-of-credit right is a type of &quot;supporting obligation,&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. Under Sections 9-203 and 9-308, a security interest in a letter-of-credit right automatically attaches and is automatically perfected if the security interest in the supported obligation is a perfected security interest. However, unless the secured party has control of the letter-of-credit right or itself becomes a transferee beneficiary, it cannot obtain any rights against the issuer or a nominated person under Article 5. Consequently, as a practical matter, the secured party&#39;s rights would be limited to its ability to locate and identify proceeds distributed by the issuer or nominated person under the letter of credit.</span>
