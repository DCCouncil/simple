Subsection (a), like former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-318.html'>Section 9-318(1)</a>, provides that an assignee generally takes an assignment subject to defenses and claims of an account debtor. Under subsection (a)(1), if the account debtor&#39;s defenses on an assigned claim arise from the transaction that gave rise to the contract with the assignor, it makes no difference whether the defense or claim accrues before or after the account debtor is notified of the assignment. Under subsection (a)(2), the assignee takes subject to other defenses or claims only if they accrue before the account debtor has been notified of the assignment. Of course, an account debtor may waive its right to assert defenses or claims against an assignee under Section 9-403 or other applicable law. Subsection (a) tracks <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-305.html'>Section 3-305(a)(3)</a> more closely than its predecessor.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Limitation on Affirmative Claims. Subsection (b) is new. It limits the claim that the account debtor may assert against an assignee. Borrowing from <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-305.html'>Section 3-305(a)(3)</a> and cases construing former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-318.html'>Section 9-318</a>, subsection (b) generally does not afford the account debtor the right to an affirmative recovery from an assignee.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Consumer Account Debtors; Relationship to Federal Trade Commission Rule. Subsections (c) and (d) also are new. Subsection (c) makes clear that the rules of this section are subject to other law establishing special rules for consumer account debtors. An &quot;account debtor who is an individual&quot; as used in subsection (c) includes individuals who are jointly or jointly and severally obligated. Subsection (d) applies to rights evidenced by a record that is required to contain, but does not contain, the notice set forth in Federal Trade Commission Rule 433, 16 C.F.R. Part 433 (the &quot;Holder-in-Due-Course Regulations&quot;). Under subsection (d), a consumer account debtor has the same right to an affirmative recovery from an assignee of such a record as the consumer would have had against the assignee had the record contained the required notice.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Scope; Application to &quot;Account Debtor.&quot; This section deals only with the rights and duties of &quot;account debtors&quot;-and for the most part only with account debtors on accounts, chattel paper, and payment intangibles. Subsection (e) provides that the obligation of an insurer with respect to a health-care-insurance receivable is governed by other law. References in this section to an &quot;account debtor&quot; include account debtors on collateral that is proceeds. Neither this section nor any other provision of this Article, including Sections 9-408 and 9-409, provides analogous regulation of the rights and duties of other obligors on collateral, such as the maker of a negotiable instrument (governed by Article 3), the issuer of or nominated person under a letter of credit (governed by Article 5), or the issuer of a security (governed by Article 8). Article 9 leaves those rights and duties untouched; however, Section 9-409 deals with the special case of letters of credit. When chattel paper is composed in part of a negotiable instrument, the obligor on the instrument is not an &quot;account debtor,&quot; and Article 3 governs the rights of the assignee of the chattel paper with respect to the issues that this section addresses. See, e.g., <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-6/3-601.html'>Section 3-601</a> (dealing with discharge of an obligation to pay a negotiable instrument).</span>
