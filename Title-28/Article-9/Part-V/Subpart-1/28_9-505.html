                    <span class="" style="">2. Precautionary Filing. Occasionally, doubts arise concerning whether a transaction creates a relationship to which this Article or its filing provisions apply. For example, questions may arise over whether a &quot;lease&quot; of equipment in fact creates a security interest or whether the &quot;sale&quot; of payment intangibles in fact secures an obligation, thereby requiring action to perfect the security interest. This section, which derives from former Section 9-408, affords the option of filing of a financing statement with appropriate changes of terminology but without affecting the substantive question of classification of the transaction.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Changes from Former Section 9-408. This section expands the rule of Section 9-408 to embrace more generally other bailments and transactions, as well as sales transactions, primarily sales of payment intangibles and promissory notes. It provides the same benefits for compliance with a statute or treaty described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(a)</a> that former Section 9-408 provided for filing, in connection with the use of terms such as &quot;lessor,&quot; &quot;consignor,&quot; etc. The references to &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;registered owner&quot; are intended to address, for example, the situation where a putative lessor is the registered owner of an automobile covered by a certificate of title and the transaction is determined to create a security interest. Although this section provides that the security interest is perfected, the relevant certificate-of-title statute may expressly provide to the contrary or may be ambiguous. If so, it may be necessary or advisable to amend the certificate-of-title statute to ensure that perfection of the security interest will be achieved.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">As does Section 1-201, former Article 9 referred to transactions, including leases and consignments, &quot;intended as security.&quot; This misleading phrase created the erroneous impression that the parties to a transaction can dictate how the law will classify it (e.g., as a bailment or as a security interest) and thus affect the rights of third parties. This Article deletes the phrase wherever it appears. Subsection (b) expresses the principle more precisely by referring to a security interest that &quot;secures an obligation.&quot;</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">4. Consignments. Although a &quot;true&quot; consignment is a bailment, the filing and priority provisions of former Article 9 applied to &quot;true&quot; consignments. See former Sections 2-326(3), 9-114. A consignment &quot;intended as security&quot; created a security interest that was in all respects subject to former Article 9. This Article subsumes most true consignments under the rubric of &quot;security interest.&quot; See Sections 9-102 (definition of &quot;consignment&quot;), 9-109(a)(4), 1-201(37) (definition of &quot;security interest&quot;). Nevertheless, it maintains the distinction between a (true) &quot;consignment,&quot; as to which only certain aspects of Article 9 apply, and a so-called consignment that actually &quot;secures an obligation,&quot; to which Article 9 applies in full. The revisions to this section reflect the change in terminology.</span>
