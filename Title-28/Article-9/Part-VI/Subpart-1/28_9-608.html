                    <span class="" style="">Example: An enforcing secured party receives a promissory note from an account debtor who is unable to pay an account when it is due. The secured party accepts the note in exchange for extending the date on which the account debtor&#39;s obligation is due. The secured party may wish to credit its debtor (the assignor) with the principal amount of the note upon receipt of the note, but probably will prefer to credit the debtor only as and when the note is paid.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Under subsection (a)(3), the secured party is under no duty to apply the note or its value to the outstanding obligation unless its failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable. If the secured party does apply the note to the outstanding obligation, however, it must do so in a commercially reasonable manner. The parties may provide for the method of application of noncash proceeds by agreement, if the method is not manifestly unreasonable. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-6/9-603.html'>Section 9-603</a>. This section does not explain when the failure to apply noncash proceeds would be commercially unreasonable; it leaves that determination to case-by-case adjudication. In the example, the secured party appears to have accepted the account debtor&#39;s note in order to increase the likelihood of payment and decrease the likelihood that the account debtor would dispute its obligation. Under these circumstances, it may well be commercially reasonable for the secured party to credit its debtor&#39;s obligations only as and when cash proceeds are collected from the account debtor, especially given the uncertainty that attends the account debtor&#39;s eventual payment. For an example of a secured party&#39;s receipt of noncash proceeds in which it may well be commercially unreasonable for the secured party to delay crediting its debtor&#39;s obligations with the value of noncash proceeds, see Section 9-615, Comment 3.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">When the secured party is not required to &quot;apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds,&quot; the proceeds nonetheless remain collateral subject to this Article. If the secured party were to dispose of them, for example, appropriate notification would be required (see Section 9-611), and the disposition would be subject to the standards provided in this Part (see Section 9-610). Moreover, a secured party in possession of the noncash proceeds would have the duties specified in Section 9-207.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. No Effect on Priority of Senior Security Interest. The application of proceeds required by subsection (a) does not affect the priority of a security interest in collateral which is senior to the interest of the secured party who is collecting or enforcing collateral under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-6/9-607.html'>Section 9-607</a>. Although subsection (a) imposes a duty to apply proceeds to the enforcing secured party&#39;s expenses and to the satisfaction of the secured obligations owed to it and to subordinate secured parties, that duty applies only among the enforcing secured party and those persons. Concerning the priority of a junior secured party who collects and enforces collateral, see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-6/9-607.html'>Section 9-607</a>, Comment 5.</span>
