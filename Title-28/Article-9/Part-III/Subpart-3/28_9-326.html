The security interest is subordinated to security interests in the same collateral perfected by another method, e.g., by filing against the new debtor. As used in this section, &quot;a filed financing statement that is effective solely under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508</a>&quot; refers to a financing statement filed against the original debtor that continues to be effective under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508</a>. It does not encompass a new initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor, even if the initial financing statement is filed to maintain the effectiveness of a financing statement under the circumstances described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508(b)</a>. Nor does it encompass a financing statement filed against the original debtor which remains effective against collateral transferred by the original debtor to the new debtor. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508(c)</a>.

Z Corp becomes bound as debtor by X Corp&#39;s security agreement (e.g., Z Corp buys X Corp&#39;s assets and assumes its security agreement). See Section 9-203(d).

Rather, the normal priority rules apply.

                    <span class="" style="">The second sentence of subsection (b) reflects the generally accepted view that priority based on the first-to-file rule is inappropriate for resolving priority disputes when the filings were made against different debtors. Like subsection (a) and the first sentence of subsection (b), however, the second sentence of subsection (b) relates only to priority conflicts among security interests perfected by filed financing statements that are &quot;effective solely under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508</a>.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 6: Under the facts of Example 5, after Z Corp became bound by W Corp&#39;s security agreement, SP-W promptly filed a new initial financing statement against Z Corp. At that time, SP-X&#39;s security interest was perfected only pursuant to its original filing against X Corp which was &quot;effective solely under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508</a>.&quot; Because SP-W&#39;s security interest is not perfected by a financing statement that is &quot;effective solely under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-508.html'>Section 9-508</a>,&quot; this section does not apply to the priority contest. Rather, the normal priority rules apply. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>, because SP-W&#39;s financing statement was the first to be filed against Z Corp, the new debtor, SP-W&#39;s security interest is senior to that of SP-X. Similarly, the normal priority rules would govern priority between SP-W and SP-Z.</span>
