Subsection (b) contains a rule governing continued perfection of a security interest in goods that become an accession.

                    <span class="" style="">5. Matters Left to Other Provisions of This Article: Attachment and Perfection. Other provisions of this Article often govern accession-related issues. For example, this section does not address whether a secured party acquires a security interest in the whole if its collateral becomes an accession. Normally this will turn on the description of the collateral in the security agreement.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Similarly, this section does not determine whether perfection against collateral that becomes an accession is effective to perfect a security interest in the whole. Other provisions of this Article, including the requirements for indicating the collateral covered by a financing statement, resolve that question.</span>

With one exception, concerning goods covered by a certificate of title (see subsection (d)), the other provisions of this Part, including the rules governing purchase-money security interests, determine the priority of most security interests in an accession, including the relative priority of a security interest in an accession and a security interest in the whole. See subsection (c).</span>

Debtor acquires memory and grants a perfected security interest in the memory to SP-2. Debtor installs the memory in the computer, at which time (one assumes) SP-1&#39;s security interest attaches to the memory. The first-to-file-or-perfect rule of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a> governs priority in the memory. If, however, SP-2&#39;s security interest is a purchase-money security interest, <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-324.html'>Section 9-324(a)</a> would afford priority in the memory to SP-2, regardless of which security interest was perfected first.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Goods Covered by Certificate of Title. This section does govern the priority of a security interest in an accession that is or becomes part of a whole that is subject to a security interest perfected by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute. Subsection (d) provides that a security interest in the whole, perfected by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute, takes priority over a security interest in the accession. It enables a secured party to rely upon a certificate of title without having to check the UCC files to determine whether any components of the collateral may be encumbered. The subsection imposes a corresponding risk upon those who finance goods that may become part of goods covered by a certificate of title. In doing so, it reverses the priority that appeared reasonable to most pre-UCC courts.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 4: Debtor owns an automobile subject to a security interest in favor of SP-1. The security interest is perfected by notation on the certificate of title. Debtor buys tires subject to a perfected-by-filing purchase-money security interest in favor of SP-2 and mounts the tires on the automobile&#39;s wheels. If the security interest in the automobile attaches to the tires, then SP-1 acquires priority over SP-2. The same result would obtain if SP-1&#39;s security interest attached to the automobile and was perfected after the tires had been mounted on the wheels.</span>
