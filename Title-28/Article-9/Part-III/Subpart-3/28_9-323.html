This section collects all of the special rules dealing with the priority of advances made by a secured party after a third party acquires an interest in the collateral.

                    <span class="" style="">3. Competing Security Interests. Under a proper reading of the first-to-file-or-perfect rule of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a> (and former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312(5)</a>), it is abundantly clear that the time when an advance is made plays no role in determining priorities among conflicting security interests except when a financing statement was not filed and the advance is the giving of value as the last step for attachment and perfection. Thus, a secured party takes subject to all advances secured by a competing security interest having priority under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>. This result generally obtains regardless of how the competing security interest is perfected and regardless of whether the advances are made &quot;pursuant to commitment&quot; (Section 9-102). Subsection (a) of this section states the only other instance when the time of an advance figures in the priority scheme in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>: when the security interest is perfected only automatically under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-309.html'>Section 9-309</a> or temporarily under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312(e)</a>, (f), or (g), and the advance is not made pursuant to a commitment entered into while the security interest was perfected by another method. Thus, an advance has priority from the date it is made only in the rare case in which it is made without commitment and while the security interest is perfected only temporarily under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The new formulation in subsection (a) clarifies the result when the initial advance is paid and a new (&quot;future&quot;) advance is made subsequently. Under former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312(7)</a>, the priority of the new advance turned on whether it was &quot;made while a security interest is perfected.&quot; This section resolves any ambiguity by omitting the quoted phrase.</span>

On March 1, B makes an advance secured by the same machinery and files a financing statement. On April 1, A makes a further advance, under the original security agreement, against the same machinery. A was the first to file and so, under the first-to-file-or-perfect rule of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>, A&#39;s security interest has priority over B&#39;s, both as to the February 1 and as to the April 1 advance. It makes no difference whether A knows of B&#39;s intervening advance when A makes the second advance. Note that, as long as A was the first to file or perfect, A would have priority with respect to both advances if either A or B had perfected by taking possession of the collateral. Likewise, A would have priority if A&#39;s April 1 advance was not made under the original agreement with the debtor, but was under a new agreement.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 2: On October 1, A acquires a temporarily perfected (20-day) security interest, unfiled, in a negotiable document in the debtor&#39;s possession under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312(e)</a> or (f). The security interest secures an advance made on that day as well as future advances. On October 5, B files and thereby perfects a security interest that previously had attached to the same document. On October 8, A makes an additional advance. On October 10, A files. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>, because A was the first to perfect and maintained continuous perfection or filing since the start of the 20-day period, A has priority, even after the 20-day period expires. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>, Comment 4, Example 3. However, under this section, for purposes of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>, to the extent A&#39;s security interest secures the October 8 advance, the security interest was perfected on October 8.

Subsection (b) replaces former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(4)</a> and addresses the rights of a &quot;lien creditor,&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317(a)(2)</a>, a security interest is senior to the rights of a person who becomes a lien creditor, unless the person becomes a lien creditor before the security interest is perfected and before a financing statement covering the collateral is filed and Section 9-203(b)(3) is satisfied. Subsection (b) of this section provides that a security interest is subordinate to those rights to the extent that the specified circumstances occur. Subsection (b) does not elevate the priority of a security interest that is subordinate to the rights of a lien creditor under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317(a)(2)</a>; it only subordinates.</span>

Rather, because of the impact of the rule in subsection (b) on the question whether the security interest for future advances is &quot;protected&quot; under Section 6323(c)(2) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, the priority of the security interest for future advances over a lien creditor is made absolute for 45 days regardless of knowledge of the secured party concerning the lien. If, however, the advance is made after the 45 days, the advance will not have priority unless it was made or committed without knowledge of the lien.</span>

Under subsections (d) and (e), a buyer will not take subject to a security interest to the extent it secures advances made after the secured party has knowledge that the buyer has purchased the collateral or more than 45 days after the purchase unless the advances were made pursuant to a commitment entered into before the expiration of the 45-day period and without knowledge of the purchase. Subsections (f) and (g) provide an analogous rule for lessees. Of course, a buyer in ordinary course who takes free of the security interest under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-320.html'>Section 9-320</a> and a lessee in ordinary course who takes free under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-321.html'>Section 9-321</a> are not subject to any future advances. Subsections (d) and (e) replace former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307(3)</a>, and subsections (f) and (g) replace former Section 2A-307(4).
