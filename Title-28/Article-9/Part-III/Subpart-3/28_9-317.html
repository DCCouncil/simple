The definition of &quot;lien creditor&quot; now appears in Section 9-102, and the rules governing priority in future advances are found in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-323.html'>Section 9-323</a>.</span>

Competing Security Interests. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a> states general rules for determining priority among conflicting security interests and refers to other sections that state special rules of priority in a variety of situations. The security interests given priority under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a> and the other sections to which it refers take priority in general even over a perfected security interest. A fortiori they take priority over an unperfected security interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Filed but Unattached Security Interest vs. Lien Creditor. Under former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)(b)</a>, a lien creditor&#39;s rights had priority over an unperfected security interest. Perfection required attachment (former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-303.html'>Section 9-303</a>) and attachment required the giving of value (former Section 9-203). It followed that, if a secured party had filed a financing statement but the debtor had not entered into a security agreement and value had not yet been given, an intervening lien creditor whose lien arose after filing but before attachment of the security interest acquired rights that are senior to those of the secured party who later gives value.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">This result comported with the nemo dat concept: When the security interest attached, the collateral was already subject to the judicial lien.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">On the other hand, this approach treated the first secured advance differently from all other advances, even in circumstances in which a security agreement covering the collateral had been entered into before the judicial lien attached. The special rule for future advances in former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(4)</a> (substantially reproduced in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-323.html'>Section 9-323(b)</a>) afforded priority to a discretionary advance made by a secured party within 45 days after the lien creditor&#39;s rights arose as long as the secured party was &quot;perfected&quot; when the lien creditor&#39;s lien arose-i.e., as long as the advance was not the first one and an earlier advance had been made.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (a)(2) revises former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)(b)</a> and, in appropriate cases, treats the first advance the same as subsequent advances. More specifically, a judicial lien that arises after the security-agreement condition of Section 9-203(b)(3) is satisfied and a financing statement is filed, but before the security interest attaches and becomes perfected is subordinate to all advances secured by the security interest, even the first advance, except as otherwise provided in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-323.html'>Section 9-323(b)</a>. However, if the security interest becomes unperfected (e.g., because the effectiveness of the filed financing statement lapses) before the judicial lien arises, the security interest is subordinate. If a financing statement is filed but a security interest does not attach, then no priority contest arises. The lien creditor has the only enforceable claim to the property.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Security Interest of Consignor or Receivables Buyer vs. Lien Creditor. Section 1-201(37) defines &quot;security interest&quot; to include the interest of most true consignors of goods and the interest of most buyers of certain receivables (accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, and promissory notes). A consignee of goods or a seller of accounts or chattel paper each is deemed to have rights in the collateral which a lien creditor may reach, as long as the competing security interest of the consignor or buyer is unperfected. This is so even though, as between the consignor and the debtor-consignee, the latter has only limited rights, and, as between the buyer and debtor-seller, the latter does not have any rights in the collateral. See Sections 9-318 (seller), 9-319 (consignee). Security interests arising from sales of payment intangibles and promissory notes are automatically perfected. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-309.html'>Section 9-309</a>. Accordingly, a subsequent judicial lien always would be subordinate to the rights of a buyer of those types of receivables.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Purchasers Other Than Secured Parties. Subsections (b), (c), and (d) afford priority over an unperfected security interest to certain purchasers (other than secured parties) of collateral. They derive from former Sections 9-301(1)(c), 2A-307(2), and 9-301(d). Former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(1)(c)</a> and (1)(d) provided that unperfected security interests are &quot;subordinate&quot; to the rights of certain purchasers. But, as former Comment 9 suggested, the practical effect of subordination in this context is that the purchaser takes free of the security interest. To avoid any possible misinterpretation, subsections (b) and (d) of this section use the phrase &quot;takes free.&quot;</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (b) governs goods, as well as intangibles of the type whose transfer is effected by physical delivery of the representative piece of paper (tangible chattel paper, documents, instruments, and security certificates). To obtain priority, a buyer must both give value and receive delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the existing security interest and before perfection. Even if the buyer gave value without knowledge and before perfection, the buyer would take subject to the security interest if perfection occurred before physical delivery of the collateral to the buyer. Subsection (c) contains a similar rule with respect to lessees of goods. Note that a lessee of goods in ordinary course of business takes free of all security interests created by the lessor, even if perfected. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-321.html'>Section 9-321</a>.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Normally, there will be no question when a buyer of chattel paper, documents, instruments, or security certificates &quot;receives delivery&quot; of the property. See Section 1-201 (defining &quot;delivery&quot;). However, sometimes a buyer or lessee of goods, such as complex machinery, takes delivery of the goods in stages and completes assembly at its own location. Under those circumstances, the buyer or lessee &quot;receives delivery&quot; within the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) when, after an inspection of the portion of the goods remaining with the seller or lessor, it would be apparent to a potential lender to the seller or lessor that another person might have an interest in the goods.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">The rule of subsection (b) obviously is not appropriate where the collateral consists of intangibles and there is no representative piece of paper whose physical delivery is the only or the customary method of transfer. Therefore, with respect to such intangibles (accounts, electronic chattel paper, general intangibles, and investment property other than certificated securities), subsection (d) gives priority to any buyer who gives value without knowledge, and before perfection, of the security interest. A licensee of a general intangible takes free of an unperfected security interest in the general intangible under the same circumstances. Note that a licensee of a general intangible in ordinary course of business takes rights under a nonexclusive license free of security interests created by the licensor, even if perfected. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-321.html'>Section 9-321</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Unless Section 9-109 excludes the transaction from this Article, a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes is a &quot;secured party&quot; (defined in Section 9-102), and subsections (b) and (d) do not determine priority of the security interest created by the sale. Rather, the priority rules generally applicable to competing security interests apply. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>.</span>

It provides that, if a purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing no later than 20 days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of buyers, lessees, or lien creditors which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing. Subsection (e) differs from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301(2)</a> in two significant respects. First, subsection (e) protects a purchase-money security interest against all buyers and lessees, not just against transferees in bulk. Second, subsection (e) conditions this protection on filing within 20, as opposed to ten, days after delivery.</span>
