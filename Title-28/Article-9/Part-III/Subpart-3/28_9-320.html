                    <span class="" style="">2. Scope of This Section. This section states when buyers of goods take free of a security interest even though perfected. Of course, a buyer who takes free of a perfected security interest takes free of an unperfected one. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a> should be consulted to determine what purchasers, in addition to the buyers covered in this section, take free of an unperfected security interest. Article 2 states general rules on purchase of goods from a seller with defective or voidable title (<a href='/dccode/Title-2/Chapter-4/Subchapter-I/2-403.html'>Section 2-403</a>).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Buyers in Ordinary Course. Subsection (a) derives from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307(1)</a>. The definition of &quot;buyer in ordinary course of business&quot; in Section 1-201 restricts its application to buyers &quot;from a person, other than a pawnbroker, in the business of selling goods of that kind.&quot; Thus subsection (a) applies primarily to inventory collateral. The subsection further excludes from its operation buyers of &quot;farm products&quot;(defined in Section 9-102) from a person engaged in farming operations. The buyer in ordinary course of business is defined as one who buys goods &quot;in good faith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person and in the ordinary course.&quot; Subsection (a) provides that such a buyer takes free of a security interest, even though perfected, and even though the buyer knows the security interest exists. Reading the definition together with the rule of law results in the buyer&#39;s taking free if the buyer merely knows that a security interest covers the goods but taking subject if the buyer knows, in addition, that the sale violates a term in an agreement with the secured party.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">As did former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307(1)</a>, subsection (a) applies only to security interests created by the seller of the goods to the buyer in ordinary course. However, under certain circumstances a buyer in ordinary course who buys goods that were encumbered with a security interest created by a person other than the seller may take free of the security interest, as Example 2 explains. See also Comment 6, below.</span>

Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, who is in the business of buying and selling used equipment. Buyer buys the equipment from Dealer. Even if Buyer qualifies as a buyer in the ordinary course of business, Buyer does not take free of Lender&#39;s security interest under subsection (a), because Dealer did not create the security interest; Manufacturer did.</span>

However, a buyer of farm products may take free of a security interest under Section 1324 of the Food Security Act of 1985, 7 U.S.C. § 1631.</span>

Subsection (b), which derives from former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-307.html'>Section 9-307(2)</a>, deals with buyers of collateral that the debtor-seller holds as &quot;consumer goods&quot; (defined in Section 9-102). Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-309.html'>Section 9-309(1)</a>, a purchase-money interest in consumer goods, except goods that are subject to a statute or treaty described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(a)</a> (such as automobiles that are subject to a certificate-of-title statute), is perfected automatically upon attachment. There is no need to file to perfect. Under subsection (b) a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though perfected, if the buyer buys (1) without knowledge of the security interest, (2) for value, (3) primarily for the buyer&#39;s own personal, family, or household purposes, and (4) before a financing statement is filed.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">As to security interests for which a perfection step is required: This category includes all non-purchase-money security interests, and all security interests, whether or not purchase-money, in goods subject to a statute or treaty described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(a)</a>, such as automobiles covered by a certificate-of-title statute. As long as the required perfection step has not been taken and the security interest remains unperfected, not only the buyers described in subsection (b) but also the purchasers described in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a> will take free of the security interest. After a financing statement has been filed or the perfection requirements of the applicable certificate-of-title statute have been complied with (compliance is the equivalent of filing a financing statement; see <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a>), all subsequent buyers, under the rule of subsection (b), are subject to the security interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The rights of a buyer under subsection (b) turn on whether a financing statement has been filed against consumer goods. Occasionally, a debtor changes his or her location after a filing is made. Subsection (c), which derives from former Section 9-103(1)(d)(iii), deals with the continued effectiveness of the filing under those circumstances. It adopts the rules of Sections 9-316(a) and (b). These rules are explained in the Comments to that section.</span>

The limitations that subsections (a) and (b) impose on the persons who may take free of a security interest apply of course only to unauthorized sales by the debtor. If the secured party authorized the sale in an express agreement or otherwise, the buyer takes free under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(a)</a> without regard to the limitations of this section. (That section also states the right of a secured party to the proceeds of a sale, authorized or unauthorized.) Moreover, the buyer also takes free if the secured party waived or otherwise is precluded from asserting its security interest against the buyer. See <a href='/dccode/Title-1/Chapter-1/Subchapter-I/1-103.html'>Section 1-103</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Oil, Gas, and Other Minerals. Under subsection (d), a buyer in ordinary course of business of minerals at the wellhead or minehead or after extraction takes free of a security interest created by the seller. Specifically, it provides that qualified buyers take free not only of Article 9 security interests but also of interests &quot;arising out of an encumbrance.&quot; As defined in Section 9-102, the term &quot;encumbrance&quot; means &quot;a right, other than an ownership interest, in real property.&quot; Thus, to the extent that a mortgage encumbers minerals not only before but also after extraction, subsection (d) enables a buyer in ordinary course of the minerals to take free of the mortgage. This subsection does not, however, enable these buyers to take free of interests arising out of ownership interests in the real property. This issue is significant only in a minority of states. Several of them have adopted special statutes and nonuniform amendments to Article 9 to provide special protections to mineral owners, whose interests often are highly fractionalized in the case of oil and gas. See Terry I. Cross, Oil and Gas Product Liens - Statutory Security Interests for Producers and Royalty Owners Under the Statutes of Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, 50 Consumer Fin. L. Q. Rep. 418 (1996). Inasmuch as a complete resolution of the issue would require the addition of complex provisions to this Article, and there are good reasons to believe that a uniform solution would not be feasible, this Article leaves its resolution to other legislation.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">8. Possessory Security Interests. Subsection (e) is new. It rejects the holding of Tanbro Fabrics Corp. v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 350 N.E.2d 590 (N.Y.1976) and, together with <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317(b)</a>, prevents a buyer of goods collateral from taking free of a security interest if the collateral is in the possession of the secured party. &quot;The secured party&quot; referred in subsection (e) is the holder of the security interest referred to in subsection (a) or (b). <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313</a> determines whether a secured party is in possession for purposes of this section. Under some circumstances, <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313</a> provides that a secured party is in possession of collateral even if the collateral is in the physical possession of a third party.</span>
