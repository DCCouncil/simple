Subsections (a) and (b) follow former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308</a> in distinguishing between earlier-perfected security interests in chattel paper that is claimed merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest and chattel paper that is claimed other than merely as proceeds. Like former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308</a>, this section does not elaborate upon the phrase &quot;merely as proceeds.&quot; For an elaboration, see PEB Commentary No. 8.</span>

Concerning the last, this Article deletes former Section 9-108 and adds to Section 9-102 a completely different definition of the term &quot;new value.&quot; Under subsection (e), the holder of a purchase-money security interest in inventory is deemed to give &quot;new value&quot; for chattel paper constituting the proceeds of the inventory. Accordingly, the purchase-money secured party may qualify for priority in the chattel paper under subsection (a) or (b), whichever is applicable, even if it does not make an additional advance against the chattel paper.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">If a possessory security interest in tangible chattel paper or a perfected-by-control security interest in electronic chattel paper does not qualify for priority under this section, it may be subordinate to a perfected-by-filing security interest under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)(1)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Possession. The priority afforded by this section turns in part on whether a purchaser &quot;takes possession&quot; of tangible chattel paper. Similarly, the governing law provisions in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-301.html'>Section 9-301</a> address both &quot;possessory&quot; and &quot;nonpossessory&quot; security interests. Two common practices have raised particular concerns. First, in some cases the parties create more than one copy or counterpart of chattel paper evidencing a single secured obligation or lease. This practice raises questions as to which counterpart is the &quot;original&quot; and whether it is necessary for a purchaser to take possession of all counterparts in order to &quot;take possession&quot; of the chattel paper. Second, parties sometimes enter into a single &quot;master&quot; agreement. The master agreement contemplates that the parties will enter into separate &quot;schedules&quot; from time to time, each evidencing chattel paper. Must a purchaser of an obligation or lease evidenced by a single schedule also take possession of the master agreement as well as the schedule in order to &quot;take possession&quot; of the chattel paper?</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">The problem raised by the first practice is easily solved. The parties may in the terms of their agreement and by designation on the chattel paper identify only one counterpart as the original chattel paper for purposes of taking possession of the chattel paper. Concerns about the second practice also are easily solved by careful drafting. Each schedule should provide that it incorporates the terms of the master agreement, not the other way around. This will make it clear that each schedule is a &quot;stand alone&quot; document.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Chattel Paper Claimed Merely as Proceeds. Subsection (a) revises the rule in former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308(b)</a> to eliminate reference to what the purchaser knows. Instead, a purchaser who meets the possession or control, ordinary course, and new value requirements takes priority over a competing security interest unless the chattel paper itself indicates that it has been assigned to an identified assignee other than the purchaser. Thus subsection (a) recognizes the common practice of placing a &quot;legend&quot; on chattel paper to indicate that it has been assigned. This approach, under which the chattel paper purchaser who gives new value in ordinary course can rely on possession of unlegended, tangible chattel paper without any concern for other facts that it may know, comports with the expectations of both inventory and chattel paper financers.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Chattel Paper Claimed Other Than Merely as Proceeds. Subsection (b) eliminates the requirement that the purchaser take without knowledge that the &quot;specific paper&quot; is subject to the security interest and substitutes for it the requirement that the purchaser take &quot;without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.&quot; This standard derives from the definition of &quot;buyer in ordinary course of business&quot; in Section 1-201(9). The source of the purchaser&#39;s knowledge is irrelevant. Note, however, that &quot;knowledge&quot; means &quot;actual knowledge.&quot; Section 1-201(25).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In contrast to a junior secured party in accounts, who may be required in some special circumstances to undertake a search under the &quot;good faith&quot; requirement, see Comment 5 to Section 9-331, a purchaser of chattel paper under this section is not required as a matter of good faith to make a search in order to determine the existence of prior security interests. There may be circumstances where the purchaser undertakes a search nevertheless, either on its own volition or because other considerations make it advisable to do so, e.g., where the purchaser also is purchasing accounts. Without more, a purchaser of chattel paper who has seen a financing statement covering the chattel paper or who knows that the chattel paper is encumbered with a security interest, does not have knowledge that its purchase violates the secured party&#39;s rights. However, if a purchaser sees a statement in a financing statement to the effect that a purchase of chattel paper from the debtor would violate the rights of the filed secured party, the purchaser would have such knowledge. Likewise, under new subsection (f), if the chattel paper itself indicates that it had been assigned to an identified secured party other than the purchaser, the purchaser would have wrongful knowledge for purposes of subsection (b), thereby preventing the purchaser from qualifying for priority under that subsection, even if the purchaser did not have actual knowledge. In the case of tangible chattel paper, the indication normally would consist of a written legend on the chattel paper. In the case of electronic chattel paper, this Article leaves to developing market and technological practices the manner in which the chattel paper would indicate an assignment.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Instruments. Subsection (d) contains a special priority rule for instruments. Under this subsection, a purchaser of an instrument has priority over a security interest perfected by a method other than possession (e.g., by filing, temporarily under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-312.html'>Section 9-312(e)</a> or (g), as proceeds under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a>, or automatically upon attachment under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-309.html'>Section 9-309(4)</a> if the security interest arises out of a sale of the instrument) if the purchaser gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. Generally, to the extent subsection (d) conflicts with <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-306~P.html'>Section 3-306</a>, subsection (d) governs. See <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-102.html'>Section 3-102(b)</a>. For example, notice of a conflicting security interest precludes a purchaser from becoming a holder in due course under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-302.html'>Section 3-302</a> and thereby taking free of all claims to the instrument under <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-306~P.html'>Section 3-306</a>. However, a purchaser who takes even with knowledge of the security interest qualifies for priority under subsection (d) if it takes without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the holder of the security interest. Likewise, a purchaser qualifies for priority under subsection (d) if it takes for &quot;value&quot; as defined in Section 1-201, even if it does not take for &quot;value&quot; as defined in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (d) is subject to Section 9-331(a), which provides that Article 9 does not limit the rights of a holder in due course under Article 3. Thus, in the rare case in which the purchaser of an instrument qualifies for priority under subsection (d), but another person has the rights of a holder in due course of the instrument, the other person takes free of the purchaser&#39;s claim. See <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-306~P.html'>Section 3-306</a>.</span>

The observations in Comment 6 concerning the requirement of good faith and the phrase &quot;without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party&quot; apply equally to purchasers of instruments. However, unlike a purchaser of chattel paper, to qualify for priority under this section a purchaser of an instrument need only give &quot;value&quot; as defined in Section 1-201; it need not give &quot;new value.&quot; Also, the purchaser need not purchase the instrument in the ordinary course of its business.</span>

This is the same good-faith requirement applicable to holders in due course. See Section 9-331, Comment 5.</span>

Subsection (c) sets forth the two circumstances under which the priority afforded to a purchaser of chattel paper under subsection (a) or (b) extends also to proceeds of the chattel paper. The first is if the purchaser would have priority under the normal priority rules applicable to proceeds. The second, which the following Comments discuss in greater detail, is if the proceeds consist of the specific goods covered by the chattel paper. Former Article 9 generally was silent as to the priority of a security interest in proceeds when a purchaser qualifies for priority under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-308.html'>Section 9-308</a> (but see former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-306.html'>Section 9-306(5)(b)</a>, concerning returned and repossessed goods).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example: SP-1 has a security interest in all the inventory of a dealer in goods (Dealer); SP-1&#39;s security interest is perfected by filing. Dealer sells some of its inventory to a buyer in the ordinary course of business (BIOCOB) pursuant to a conditional sales contract (chattel paper) that does not indicate that it has been assigned to SP-1. SP-2 purchases the chattel paper from Dealer and takes possession of the paper in good faith, in the ordinary course of business, and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of SP-1. Subsequently, BIOCOB returns the goods to Dealer because they are defective. Alternatively, Dealer acquires possession of the goods following BIOCOB&#39;s default.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">(1) Returned Goods. If BIOCOB returns the goods to Dealer for repairs, Dealer is merely a bailee and acquires thereby no meaningful rights in the goods to which SP-1&#39;s security interest could attach. (Although SP-1&#39;s security interest could attach to Dealer&#39;s interest as a bailee, that interest is not likely to be of any particular value to SP-1.) Dealer is the owner of the chattel paper (i.e., the owner of a right to payment secured by a security interest in the goods); SP-2 has a security interest in the chattel paper, as does SP-1 (as proceeds of the goods under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315</a>). Under Section 9-330, SP-2&#39;s security interest in the chattel paper is senior to that of SP-1. SP-2 enjoys this priority regardless of whether, or when, SP-2 filed a financing statement covering the chattel paper. Because chattel paper and goods represent different types of collateral, Dealer does not have any meaningful interest in goods to which either SP-1&#39;s or SP-2&#39;s security interest could attach in order to secure Dealer&#39;s obligations to either creditor. See Section 9-102 (defining &quot;chattel paper&quot; and &quot;goods&quot;).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Now assume that BIOCOB returns the goods to Dealer under circumstances whereby Dealer once again becomes the owner of the goods. This would be the case, for example, if the goods were defective and BIOCOB was entitled to reject or revoke acceptance of the goods. See Sections 2-602 (rejection), 2-608 (revocation of acceptance). Unless BIOCOB has waived its defenses as against assignees of the chattel paper, SP-1&#39;s and SP-2&#39;s rights against BIOCOB would be subject to BIOCOB&#39;s claims and defenses. See Sections 9-403, 9-404. SP-1&#39;s security interest would attach again because the returned goods would be proceeds of the chattel paper. Dealer&#39;s acquisition of the goods easily can be characterized as &quot;proceeds&quot; consisting of an &quot;in kind&quot; collection on or distribution on account of the chattel paper. See Section 9-102 (definition of &quot;proceeds&quot;). Assuming that SP-1&#39;s security interest is perfected by filing against the goods and that the filing is made in the same office where a filing would be made against the chattel paper, SP-1&#39;s security interest in the goods would remain perfected beyond the 20-day period of automatic perfection. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Because Dealer&#39;s newly reacquired interest in the goods is proceeds of the chattel paper, SP-2&#39;s security interest also would attach in the goods as proceeds. If SP-2 had perfected its security interest in the chattel paper by filing (again, assuming that filing against the chattel paper was made in the same office where a filing would be made against the goods), SP-2&#39;s security interest in the reacquired goods would be perfected beyond 20 days. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a>. However, if SP-2 had relied only on its possession of the chattel paper for perfection and had not filed against the chattel paper or the goods, SP-2&#39;s security interest would be unperfected after the 20-day period. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(d)</a>. Nevertheless, SP-2&#39;s unperfected security interest in the goods would be senior to SP-1&#39;s security interest under Section 9-330(c). The result in this priority contest is not affected by SP-2&#39;s acquiescence or non-acquiescence in the return of the goods to Dealer.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">(2) Repossessed Goods. As explained above, Dealer owns the chattel paper covering the goods, subject to security interests in favor of SP-1 and SP-2. In Article 9 parlance, Dealer has an interest in chattel paper, not goods. If Dealer, SP-1, or SP-2 repossesses the goods upon BIOCOB&#39;s default, whether the repossession is rightful or wrongful as among Dealer, SP-1, or SP-2, Dealer&#39;s interest will not change. The location of goods and the party who possesses them does not affect the fact that Dealer&#39;s interest is in chattel paper, not goods. The goods continue to be owned by BIOCOB. SP-1&#39;s security interest in the goods does not attach until such time as Dealer reacquires an interest (other than a bare possessory interest) in the goods. For example, Dealer might buy the goods at a foreclosure sale from SP-2 (whose security interest in the chattel paper is senior to that of SP-1); that disposition would cut off BIOCOB&#39;s rights in the goods. Section 9-617.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In many cases the matter would end upon sale of the goods to Dealer at a foreclosure sale and there would be no priority contest between SP-1 and SP-2; Dealer would be unlikely to buy the goods under circumstances whereby SP-2 would retain its security interest. There can be exceptions, however. For example, Dealer may be obliged to purchase the goods from SP-2 and SP-2 may be obliged to convey the goods to Dealer, but Dealer may fail to pay SP-2. Or, one could imagine that SP-2, like SP-1, has a general security interest in the inventory of Dealer. In the latter case, SP-2 should not receive the benefit of any special priority rule, since its interest in no way derives from priority under Section 9-330. In the former case, SP-2&#39;s security interest in the goods reacquired by Dealer is senior to SP-1&#39;s security interest under Section 9-330.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">b. Dealer&#39;s Outright Sale of Chattel Paper to SP-2. Article 9 also applies to a transaction whereby SP-2 buys the chattel paper in an outright sale transaction without recourse against Dealer. Sections 1-201(37), 9-109(a). Although Dealer does not, in such a transaction, retain any residual ownership interest in the chattel paper, the chattel paper constitutes proceeds of the goods to which SP-1&#39;s security interest will attach and continue following the sale of the goods. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315(a)</a>. Even though Dealer has not retained any interest in the chattel paper, as discussed above BIOCOB subsequently may return the goods to Dealer under circumstances whereby Dealer reacquires an interest in the goods. The priority contest between SP-1 and SP-2 will be resolved as discussed above; Section 9-330 makes no distinction among purchasers of chattel paper on the basis of whether the purchaser is an outright buyer of chattel paper or one whose security interest secures an obligation of Dealer.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The analysis with respect to lease chattel paper is similar to that set forth above with respect to non-lease chattel paper. It is complicated, however, by the fact that, unlike the case of chattel paper arising out of a sale, Dealer retains a residual interest in the goods. See Section 2A-103(1)(q) (defining &quot;lessor&#39;s residual interest&quot;); In re Leasing Consultants, Inc., 486 F.2d 367 (2d Cir.1973) (lessor&#39;s residual interest under true lease is an interest in goods and is a separate type of collateral from lessor&#39;s interest in the lease). If Dealer leases goods to a &quot;lessee in ordinary course of business&quot; (LIOCOB), then LIOCOB takes its interest under the lease (i.e., its &quot;leasehold interest&quot;) free of the security interest of SP-1. See Sections 2A-307(3), 2A-103(1)(m) (defining &quot;leasehold interest&quot;), (1)(o) (defining &quot;lessee in ordinary course of business&quot;). SP-1 would, however, retain its security interest in the residual interest. In addition, SP-1 would acquire an interest in the lease chattel paper as proceeds. If Dealer then assigns the lease chattel paper to SP-2, Section 9-330 gives SP-2 priority over SP-1 with respect to the chattel paper, but not with respect to the residual interest in the goods. Consequently, assignees of lease chattel paper typically take a security interest in and file against the lessor&#39;s residual interest in goods, expecting their priority in the goods to be governed by the first-to-file-or-perfect rule of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">If the goods are returned to Dealer, other than upon expiration of the lease term, then the security interests of both SP-1 and SP-2 normally would attach to the goods as proceeds of the chattel paper. (If the goods are returned to Dealer at the expiration of the lease term and the lessee has made all payments due under the lease, however, then Dealer no longer has any rights under the chattel paper. Dealer&#39;s interest in the goods consists solely of its residual interest, as to which SP-2 has no claim.) This would be the case, for example, when the lessee rescinds the lease or when the lessor recovers possession in the exercise of its remedies under Article 2A. See, e.g., Section 2A-525. If SP-2 enjoyed priority in the chattel paper under Section 9-330, then SP-2 likewise would enjoy priority in the returned goods as proceeds. This does not mean that SP-2 necessarily is entitled to the entire value of the returned goods. The value of the goods represents the sum of the present value of (i) the value of their use for the term of the lease and (ii) the value of the residual interest. SP-2 has priority in the former, but SP-1 ordinarily would have priority in the latter. Thus, an allocation of a portion of the value of the goods to each component may be necessary. Where, as here, one secured party has a security interest in the lessor&#39;s residual interest and another has a priority security interest in the chattel paper, it may be advisable for the conflicting secured parties to establish a method for making such an allocation and otherwise to determine their relative rights in returned goods by agreement.</span>
