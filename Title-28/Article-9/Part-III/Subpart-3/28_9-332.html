                    <span class="" style="">2. Scope of This Section. This section affords broad protection to transferees who take funds from a deposit account and to those who take money. The term &quot;transferee&quot; is not defined; however, the debtor itself is not a transferee. Thus this section does not cover the case in which a debtor withdraws money (currency) from its deposit account or the case in which a bank debits an encumbered account and credits another account it maintains for the debtor.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">A transfer of funds from a deposit account, to which subsection (b) applies, normally will be made by check, by funds transfer, or by debiting the debtor&#39;s deposit account and crediting another depositor&#39;s account.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: Debtor maintains a deposit account with Bank A. The deposit account is subject to a perfected security interest in favor of Lender. Debtor draws a check on the account, payable to Payee. Inasmuch as the check is not the proceeds of the deposit account (it is an order to pay funds from the deposit account), Lender&#39;s security interest in the deposit account does not give rise to a security interest in the check. Payee deposits the check into its own deposit account, and Bank A pays it. Unless Payee acted in collusion with Debtor in violating Lender&#39;s rights, Payee takes the funds (the credits running in favor of Payee) free of Lender&#39;s security interest. This is true regardless of whether Payee is a holder in due course of the check and even if Payee gave no value for the check.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 2: Debtor maintains a deposit account with Bank A. The deposit account is subject to a perfected security interest in favor of Lender. At Bank B&#39;s suggestion, Debtor moves the funds from the account at Bank A to Debtor&#39;s deposit account with Bank B. Unless Bank B acted in collusion with Debtor in violating Lender&#39;s rights, Bank B takes the funds (the credits running in favor of Bank B) free from Lender&#39;s security interest. See subsection (b). However, inasmuch as the deposit account maintained with Bank B constitutes the proceeds of the deposit account at Bank A, Lender&#39;s security interest would attach to that account as proceeds. See <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (b) also would apply if, in the example, Bank A debited Debtor&#39;s deposit account in exchange for the issuance of Bank A&#39;s cashier&#39;s check. Lender&#39;s security interest would attach to the cashier&#39;s check as proceeds of the deposit account, and the rules applicable to instruments would govern any competing claims to the cashier&#39;s check. See, e.g., Sections 3-306, 9-322, 9-330, 9-331.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">If Debtor withdraws money (currency) from an encumbered deposit account and transfers the money to a third party, then subsection (a), to the extent not displaced by federal law relating to money, applies. It contains the same rule as subsection (b).</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (b) applies to transfers of funds from a deposit account; it does not apply to transfers of the deposit account itself or of an interest therein. For example, this section does not apply to the creation of a security interest in a deposit account. Competing claims to the deposit account itself are dealt with by other Article 9 priority rules. See Sections 9-317(a), 9-327, 9-340, 9-341. Similarly, a corporate merger normally would not result in a transfer of funds from a deposit account. Rather, it might result in a transfer of the deposit account itself. If so, the normal rules applicable to transferred collateral would apply; this section would not.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">3. Policy. Broad protection for transferees helps to ensure that security interests in deposit accounts do not impair the free flow of funds. It also minimizes the likelihood that a secured party will enjoy a claim to whatever the transferee purchases with the funds. Rules concerning recovery of payments traditionally have placed a high value on finality. The opportunity to upset a completed transaction, or even to place a completed transaction in jeopardy by bringing suit against the transferee of funds, should be severely limited. Although the giving of value usually is a prerequisite for receiving the ability to take free from third-party claims, where payments are concerned the law is even more protective. Thus, <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-4/3-418.html'>Section 3-418(c)</a> provides that, even where the law of restitution otherwise would permit recovery of funds paid by mistake, no recovery may be had from a person &quot;who in good faith changed position in reliance on the payment.&quot; Rather than adopt this standard, this section eliminates all reliance requirements whatsoever. Payments made by mistake are relatively rare, but payments of funds from encumbered deposit accounts (e.g., deposit accounts containing collections from accounts receivable) occur with great regularity. In most cases, unlike payment by mistake, no one would object to these payments. In the vast proportion of cases, the transferee probably would be able to show a change of position in reliance on the payment. This section does not put the transferee to the burden of having to make this proof.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. &quot;Bad Actors.&quot; To deal with the question of the &quot;bad actor,&quot; this section borrows &quot;collusion&quot; language from Article 8. See, e.g., Sections 8-115, 8-503(e). This is the most protective (i.e., least stringent) of the various standards now found in the UCC. Compare, e.g., Section 1-201(9) (&quot;without knowledge that the sale ... is in violation of the ... security interest&quot;); Section 1-201(19) (&quot;honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned&quot;); <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-302.html'>Section 3-302(a)(2)(v)</a> (&quot;without notice of any claim&quot;).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Transferee Who Does Not Take Free. This section sets forth the circumstances under which certain transferees of money or funds take free of security interests. It does not determine the rights of a transferee who does not take free of a security interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 3: The facts are as in Example 2, but, in wrongfully moving the funds from the deposit account at Bank A to Debtor&#39;s deposit account with Bank B, Debtor acts in collusion with Bank B. Bank B does not take the funds free of Lender&#39;s security interest under this section. If Debtor grants a security interest to Bank B, Section 9-327 governs the relative priorities of Lender and Bank B. Under Section 9-327(3), Bank B&#39;s security interest in the Bank B deposit account is senior to Lender&#39;s security interest in the deposit account as proceeds. However, Bank B&#39;s senior security interest does not protect Bank B against any liability to Lender that might arise from Bank B&#39;s wrongful conduct.</span>
