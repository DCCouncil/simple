                    <span class="" style="">2. Consignments. This section takes an approach to consignments similar to that taken by <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-318.html'>Section 9-318</a> with respect to buyers of accounts and chattel paper. Revised Section 1-201(37) defines &quot;security interest&quot; to include the interest of a consignor of goods under many true consignments. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-319.html'>Section 9-319(a)</a> provides that, for purposes of determining the rights of certain third parties, the consignee is deemed to acquire all rights and title that the consignor had, if the consignor&#39;s security interest is unperfected. The consignee acquires these rights even though, as between the parties, it purchases a limited interest in the goods (as would be the case in a true consignment, under which the consignee acquires only the interest of a bailee). As a consequence of this section, creditors of the consignee can acquire judicial liens and security interests in the goods.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Insofar as creditors of the consignee are concerned, this Article to a considerable extent reformulates the former law, which appeared in former Sections 2-326 and 9-114, without changing the results. However, neither Article 2 nor former Article 9 specifically addresses the rights of non-ordinary course buyers from the consignee. Former Section 9-114 contained priority rules applicable to security interests in consigned goods. Under this Article, the priority rules for purchase-money security interests in inventory apply to consignments. See Section 9-103(d). Accordingly, a special section containing priority rules for consignments no longer is needed. <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a> determines whether the rights of a judicial lien creditor are senior to the interest of the consignor, Sections 9-322 and 9-324 govern competing security interests in consigned goods, and Sections 9-317, 9-315, and 9-320 determine whether a buyer takes free of the consignor&#39;s interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: SP-1 delivers goods to Debtor in a transaction constituting a &quot;consignment&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. SP-1 does not file a financing statement. Debtor then grants a security interest in the goods to SP-2. SP-2 files a proper financing statement. Assuming Debtor is a mere bailee, as in a &quot;true&quot; consignment, Debtor would not have any rights in the collateral (beyond those of a bailee) so as to permit SP-2&#39;s security interest to attach to any greater rights. Nevertheless, under this section, for purposes of determining the rights of Debtor&#39;s creditors, Debtor is deemed to acquire SP-1&#39;s rights. Accordingly, SP-2&#39;s security interest attaches, is perfected by the filing, and, under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>, is senior to SP-1&#39;s interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Effect of Perfection. Subsection (b) contains a special rule with respect to consignments that are perfected. If application of this Article would result in the consignor having priority over a competing creditor, then other law determines the rights and title of the consignee.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 2: SP-1 delivers goods to Debtor in a transaction constituting a &quot;consignment&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. SP-1 files a proper financing statement. Debtor then grants a security interest in the goods to SP-2. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322</a>, SP-1&#39;s security interest is senior to SP-2&#39;s. Subsection (b) indicates that, for purposes of determining SP-2&#39;s rights, other law determines the rights and title of the consignee. If, for example, a consignee obtains only the special property of a bailee, then SP-2&#39;s security interest would attach only to that special property.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Example 3: SP-1 obtains a security interest in all Debtor&#39;s existing and after-acquired inventory. SP-1 perfects its security interest with a proper filing. Then SP-2 delivers goods to Debtor in a transaction constituting a &quot;consignment&quot; as defined in Section 9-102. SP-2 files a proper financing statement but does not send notification to SP-1 under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-324.html'>Section 9-324(b)</a>. Accordingly, SP-2&#39;s security interest is junior to SP-1&#39;s under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)</a>. Under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-319.html'>Section 9-319(a)</a>, Debtor is deemed to have the consignor&#39;s rights and title, so that SP-1&#39;s security interest attaches to SP-2&#39;s ownership interest in the goods. Thereafter, Debtor grants a security interest in the goods to SP-3, and SP-3 perfects by filing. Because SP-2&#39;s perfected security interest is senior to SP-3&#39;s under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-322.html'>Section 9-322(a)</a>, <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-319.html'>Section 9-319(b)</a> applies: Other law determines Debtor&#39;s rights and title to the goods insofar as SP-3 is concerned, and SP-3&#39;s security interest attaches to those rights.</span>
