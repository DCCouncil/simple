                    <span class="" style="">Some states have enacted central filing statutes with respect to secured transactions in kinds of property that are of special importance in the local economy. Subsection (a)(2) defers to these statutes with respect to filing for that property.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Inventory Covered by Certificate of Title. Under subsection (d), perfection of a security interest in the inventory of a person in the business of selling goods of that kind is governed by the normal perfection rules, even if the inventory is subject to a certificate-of-title statute. Compliance with a certificate-of-title statute is both unnecessary and ineffective to perfect a security interest in inventory to which this subsection applies. Thus, a secured party who finances an automobile dealer that is in the business of selling and leasing its inventory of automobiles can perfect a security interest in all the automobiles by filing a financing statement but not by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (d), and thus the filing and other perfection provisions of this Article, does not apply to inventory that is subject to a certificate-of-title statute and is of a kind that the debtor is not in the business of selling. For example, if goods are subject to a certificate-of-title statute and the debtor is in the business of leasing but not of selling, goods of that kind, the other subsections of this section govern perfection of a security interest in the goods. The fact that the debtor eventually sells the goods does not, of itself, mean that the debtor &quot;is in the business of selling goods of that kind.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The filing and other perfection provisions of this Article apply to goods subject to a certificate-of-title statute only &quot;during any period in which collateral is inventory held for sale or lease or leased.&quot; If the debtor takes goods of this kind out of inventory and uses them, say, as equipment, a filed financing statement would not remain effective to perfect a security interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Compliance with Perfection Requirements of Other Statute. Subsection (b) makes clear that compliance with the perfection requirements (i.e., the requirements for obtaining priority over a lien creditor), but not other requirements, of a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) is sufficient for perfection under this Article. Perfection of a security interest under such a statute, regulation, or treaty has all the consequences of perfection under this Article.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The interplay of this section with certain certificate-of-title statutes may create confusion and uncertainty. For example, statutes under which perfection does not occur until a certificate of title is issued will create a gap between the time that the goods are covered by the certificate under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-303.html'>Section 9-303</a> and the time of perfection. If the gap is long enough, it may result in turning some unobjectionable transactions into avoidable preferences under Bankruptcy Code Section 547. (The preference risk arises if more than 10 days (or 20 days, in the case of a purchase-money security interest) passes between the time a security interest attaches (or the debtor receives possession of the collateral, in the case of a purchase-money security interest) and the time it is perfected.) Accordingly, the Legislative Note to this section instructs the legislature to amend the applicable certificate-of-title statute to provide that perfection occurs upon receipt by the appropriate State official of a properly tendered application for a certificate of title on which the security interest is to be indicated.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Under some certificate-of-title statutes, including the Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act, perfection generally occurs upon delivery of specified documents to a state official but may, under certain circumstances, relate back to the time of attachment. This relation-back feature can create great difficulties for the application of the rules in Sections 9-303 and 9-311(b). Accordingly, the Legislative Note also recommends to legislatures that they remove any relation-back provisions from certificate-of-title statutes affecting security interests.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Compliance with Perfection Requirements of Other Statute as Equivalent to Filing. Under Subsection (b), compliance with the perfection requirements (i.e., the requirements for obtaining priority over a lien creditor) of a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) &quot;is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The quoted phrase appeared in former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-302.html'>Section 9-302(3)</a>. Its meaning was unclear, and many questions arose concerning the extent to which and manner in which Article 9 rules referring to &quot;filing&quot; were applicable to perfection by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute. This Article takes a variety of approaches for applying Article 9&#39;s filing rules to compliance with other statutes and treaties. First, as discussed above in Comment 5, it leaves the determination of some rules, such as the rule establishing time of perfection (Section 9-516(a)), to the other statutes themselves. Second, this Article explicitly applies some Article 9 filing rules to perfection under other statutes or treaties. See, e.g., <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-5/9-505.html'>Section 9-505</a>. Third, this Article makes other Article 9 rules applicable to security interests perfected by compliance with another statute through the &quot;equivalent to ... filing&quot; provision in the first sentence of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a>. The third approach is reflected for the most part in occasional Comments explaining how particular rules apply when perfection is accomplished under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a>. See, e.g., <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-310.html'>Section 9-310</a>, Comment 4; <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-315.html'>Section 9-315</a>, Comment 6; <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a>, Comment 8. The absence of a Comment indicating that a particular filing provision applies to perfection pursuant to <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-311.html'>Section 9-311(b)</a> does not mean the provision is inapplicable.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Perfection by Possession of Goods Covered by Certificate-of-Title Statute. A secured party who holds a security interest perfected under the law of State A in goods that subsequently are covered by a State B certificate of title may face a predicament.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Ordinarily, the secured party will have four months under State B&#39;s <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-316.html'>Section 9-316(c)</a> and (d) in which to (re)perfect as against a purchaser of the goods by having its security interest noted on a State B certificate. This procedure is likely to require the cooperation of the debtor and any competing secured party whose security interest has been noted on the certificate. Comment 4(e) to former Section 9-103 observed that &quot;that cooperation is not likely to be forthcoming from an owner who wrongfully procured the issuance of a new certificate not showing the out-of-state security interest, or from a local secured party finding himself in a priority contest with the out-of-state secured party.&quot; According to that Comment, &quot;[t]he only solution for the out-of-state secured party under present certificate of title statutes seems to be to reperfect by possession, i.e., by repossessing the goods.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">But the &quot;solution&quot; may not have worked: Former <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-302.html'>Section 9-302(4)</a> provided that a security interest in property subject to a certificate-of-title statute &quot;can be perfected only by compliance therewith.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Sections 9-316(d) and (e), 9-311(c), and 9-313(b) of this Article resolve the conflict by providing that a security interest that remains perfected solely by virtue of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-316.html'>Section 9-316(e)</a> can be (re)perfected by the secured party&#39;s taking possession of the collateral. These sections contemplate only that taking possession of goods covered by a certificate of title will work as a method of perfection. None of these sections creates a right to take possession. Section 9-609 and the agreement of the parties define the secured party&#39;s right to take possession.</span>
