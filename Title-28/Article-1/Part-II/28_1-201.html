The term &quot;security interest&quot; does not include the special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under § 28:2-401, but a buyer may also acquire a security interest by complying with Article 9. Except as otherwise provided in § 28:2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under Article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a security interest, but a seller or lessor may also acquire a security interest by complying with Article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under § 28:2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest is determined pursuant to § 28:1-203.</span>

The reference in subsection (a) to the &quot;context&quot; is intended to refer to the context in which the defined term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code. In other words, the definition applies whenever the defined term is used unless the context in which the defined term is used in the statute indicates that the term was not used in its defined sense. Consider, for example, Sections 3-103(a)(9) (defining &quot;promise,&quot; in relevant part, as &quot;a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay&quot;) and 3-303(a)(1) (indicating that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if &quot;the instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed.&quot; It is clear from the statutory context of the use of the word &quot;promise&quot; in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303(a)(1)</a> that the term was not used in the sense of its definition in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-103.html'>Section 3-103(a)(9)</a>. Thus, the <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-103.html'>Section 3-103(a)(9)</a> definition should not be used to give meaning to the word &quot;promise&quot; in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-3/Subchapter-I/3-303.html'>Section 3-303(a)</a>.</span>

The second sentence explains what it means to buy &quot;in the ordinary course.&quot; The penultimate sentence prevents a buyer that does not have the right to possession as against the seller from being a buyer in ordinary course of business. Concerning when a buyer obtains possessory rights, see Sections 2-502 and 2-716. However, the penultimate sentence is not intended to affect a buyer&#39;s status as a buyer in ordinary course of business in cases (such as a &quot;drop shipment&quot;) involving delivery by the seller to a person buying from the buyer or a donee from the buyer. The requirement relates to whether as against the seller the buyer or one taking through the buyer has possessory rights.</span>

This definition states the general standard that to be conspicuous a term ought to be noticed by a reasonable person. Whether a term is conspicuous is an issue for the court. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) set out several methods for making a term conspicuous. Requiring that a term be conspicuous blends a notice function (the term ought to be noticed) and a planning function (giving guidance to the party relying on the term regarding how that result can be achieved). Although these paragraphs indicate some of the methods for making a term attention-calling, the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it. The statutory language should not be construed to permit a result that is inconsistent with that test.</span>

Also the definition is left open so that new types of documents may be included. It is unforeseeable what documents may one day serve the essential purpose now filled by warehouse receipts and bills of lading. Truck transport has already opened up problems which do not fit the patterns of practice resting upon the assumption that a draft can move through banking channels faster than the goods themselves can reach their destination. There lie ahead air transport and such probabilities as teletype transmission of what may some day be regarded commercially as &quot;Documents of Title.&quot; The definition is stated in terms of the function of the documents with the intention that any document which gains commercial recognition as accomplishing the desired result shall be included within its scope. Fungible goods are adequately identified within the language of the definition by identification of the mass of which they are a part.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Dock warrants were within the Sales Act definition of document of title apparently for the purpose of recognizing a valid tender by means of such paper. In current commercial practice a dock warrant or receipt is a kind of interim certificate issued by steamship companies upon delivery of the goods at the dock, entitling a designated person to have issued to him at the company&#39;s office a bill of lading. The receipt itself is invariably nonnegotiable in form although it may indicate that a negotiable bill is to be forthcoming. Such a document is not within the general compass of the definition, although trade usage may in some cases entitle such paper to be treated as a document of title. If the dock receipt actually represents a storage obligation undertaken by the shipping company, then it is a warehouse receipt within this section regardless of the name given to the instrument.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Over time, however, amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code brought the Article 2 merchant concept of good faith (subjective honesty and objective commercial reasonableness) into other Articles. First, Article 2A explicitly incorporated the Article 2 standard. See Section 2A-103(7). Then, other Articles broadened the applicability of that standard by adopting it for all parties rather than just for merchants. </span>

                    <span class="" style="">the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Only revised Article 5 defines &quot;good faith&quot; solely in terms of subjective honesty, and only Article 6 and Article 7 are without definitions of good faith. (It should be noted that, while revised Article 6 did not define good faith, Comment 2 to revised Section 6-102 states that &quot;this Article adopts the definition of &#39;good faith&#39; in Article 1 in all cases, even when the buyer is a merchant.&quot;) Given these developments, it is appropriate to move the broader definition of &quot;good faith&quot; to Article 1. Of course, this definition is subject to the applicability of the narrower definition in revised Article 5.</span>
