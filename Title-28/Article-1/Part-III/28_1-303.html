In so doing, the section slightly modifies the articulation of the course of performance rules to fit more comfortably with the approach and structure of former Section 1-205. There are also slight modifications to be more consistent with the definition of &quot;agreement&quot; in former Section 1-201(3). It should be noted that a course of performance that might otherwise establish a defense to the obligation of a party to a negotiable instrument is not available as a defense against a holder in due course who took the instrument without notice of that course of performance.</span>

The measure and background for interpretation are set by the commercial context, which may explain and supplement even the language of a formal or final writing.</span>

A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a &quot;course of performance.&quot; &quot;Course of dealing&quot; may enter the agreement either by explicit provisions of the agreement or by tacit recognition.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. The Uniform Commercial Code deals with &quot;usage of trade&quot; as a factor in reaching the commercial meaning of the agreement that the parties have made. The language used is to be interpreted as meaning what it may fairly be expected to mean to parties involved in the particular commercial transaction in a given locality or in a given vocation or trade. By adopting in this context the term &quot;usage of trade,&quot; the Uniform Commercial Code expresses its intent to reject those cases which see evidence of &quot;custom&quot; as representing an effort to displace or negate &quot;established rules of law.&quot; A distinction is to be drawn between mandatory rules of law such as the Statute of Frauds provisions of Article 2 on Sales whose very office is to control and restrict the actions of the parties, and which cannot be abrogated by agreement, or by a usage of trade, and those rules of law (such as those in Part 3 of Article 2 on Sales) which fill in points which the parties have not considered and in fact agreed upon. The latter rules hold &quot;unless otherwise agreed&quot; but yield to the contrary agreement of the parties. Part of the agreement of the parties to which such rules yield is to be sought for in the usages of trade which furnish the background and give particular meaning to the language used, and are the framework of common understanding controlling any general rules of law which hold only when there is no such understanding.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. A usage of trade under subsection (c) must have the &quot;regularity of observance&quot; specified. The ancient English tests for &quot;custom&quot; are abandoned in this connection. Therefore, it is not required that a usage of trade be &quot;ancient or immemorial,&quot; &quot;universal,&quot; or the like. Under the requirement of subsection (c) full recognition is thus available for new usages and for usages currently observed by the great majority of decent dealers, even though dissidents ready to cut corners do not agree. There is room also for proper recognition of usage agreed upon by merchants in trade codes.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. The policies of the Uniform Commercial Code controlling explicit unconscionable contracts and clauses (Sections 1-304, 2-302) apply to implicit clauses that rest on usage of trade and carry forward the policy underlying the ancient requirement that a custom or usage must be &quot;reasonable.&quot; However, the emphasis is shifted. The very fact of commercial acceptance makes out a </span>

                    <span class="" style="">case that the usage is reasonable, and the burden is no longer on the usage to establish itself as being reasonable. But the anciently established policing of usage by the courts is continued to the extent necessary to cope with the situation arising if an unconscionable or dishonest practice should become standard.</span>

Subsection (d), giving the prescribed effect to usages of which the parties &quot;are or should be aware,&quot; reinforces the provision of subsection (c) requiring not universality but only the described &quot;regularity of observance&quot; of the practice or method. This subsection also reinforces the point of subsection (c) that such usages may be either general to trade or particular to a special branch of trade.</span>

Although the definition of &quot;agreement&quot; in Section 1-201 includes the elements of course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade, the fact that express reference is made in some sections to those elements is not to be construed as carrying a contrary intent or implication elsewhere. Compare Section 1-302(c).</span>

In cases of a well-established line of usage varying from the general rules of the Uniform Commercial Code where the precise amount of the variation has not been worked out into a single standard, the party relying on the usage is entitled, in any event, to the minimum variation demonstrated. The whole is not to be disregarded because no particular line of detail has been established. In case a dominant pattern has been fairly evidenced, the party relying on the usage is entitled under this section to go to the trier of fact on the question of whether such dominant pattern has been incorporated into the agreement.</span>
