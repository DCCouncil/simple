                    <span class="" style="">1. Subsection (a) states affirmatively at the outset that freedom of contract is a principle of the Uniform Commercial Code: &quot;the effect&quot; of its provisions may be varied by &quot;agreement.&quot; The meaning of the statute itself must be found in its text, including its definitions, and in appropriate extrinsic aids; it cannot be varied by agreement. But the Uniform Commercial Code seeks to avoid the type of interference with evolutionary growth found in pre-Code cases such as </span>
                
                    <span class="" style="font-style: italic; ">Manhattan Co. v. Morgan</span>
                
                    <span class="" style="">, 242 N.Y. 38, 150 N.E. 594 (1926). Thus, private parties cannot make an instrument negotiable within the meaning of Article 3 except as provided in <a href='/dccode/Title-3/Chapter-1/3-104.html'>Section 3-104</a>; nor can they change the meaning of such terms as &quot;bona fide purchaser,&quot; &quot;holder in due course,&quot; or &quot;due negotiation,&quot; as used in the Uniform Commercial Code. But an agreement can change the legal consequences that would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code. &quot;Agreement&quot; here includes the effect given to course of dealing, usage of trade and course of performance by Sections 1-201 and 1-303; the effect of an agreement on the rights of third parties is left to specific provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and to supplementary principles applicable under <a href='/dccode/Title-1/Chapter-1/Subchapter-I/1-103.html'>Section 1-103</a>. The rights of third parties under <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-317.html'>Section 9-317</a> when a security interest is unperfected, for example, cannot be destroyed by a clause in the security agreement.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">This principle of freedom of contract is subject to specific exceptions found elsewhere in the Uniform Commercial Code and to the general exception stated here. The specific exceptions vary in explicitness: the statute of frauds found in Section 2-201, for example, does not explicitly preclude oral waiver of the requirement of a writing, but a fair reading denies enforcement to such a waiver as part of the &quot;contract&quot; made unenforceable; <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-6/9-602.html'>Section 9-602</a>, on the other hand, is a quite explicit limitation on freedom of contract. Under the exception for &quot;the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by [the Uniform Commercial Code],&quot; provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code prescribing such obligations are not to be disclaimed. However, the section also recognizes the prevailing practice of having agreements set forth standards by which due diligence is measured and explicitly provides that, in the absence of a showing that the standards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls. In this connection, Section 1-303 incorporating into the agreement prior course of dealing and usages of trade is of particular importance.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (b) also recognizes that nothing is stronger evidence of a reasonable time than the fixing of such time by a fair agreement between the parties. However, provision is made for disregarding a clause which whether by inadvertence or overreaching fixes a time so unreasonable that it amounts to eliminating all remedy under the contract. The parties are not required to fix the most reasonable time but may fix any time which is not obviously unfair as judged by the time of contracting.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. An agreement that varies the effect of provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code may do so by stating the rules that will govern in lieu of the provisions varied. Alternatively, the parties may vary the effect of such provisions by stating that their relationship will be governed by recognized bodies of rules or principles applicable to commercial transactions. Such bodies of rules or principles may include, for example, those that are promulgated by intergovernmental authorities such as UNCITRAL or Unidroit (</span>
                
                    <span class="" style="font-style: italic; ">see, e.g.</span>
                
                    <span class="" style="">, Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts), or non-legal codes such as trade codes.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (c) is intended to make it clear that, as a matter of drafting, phrases such as &quot;unless otherwise agreed&quot; have been used to avoid controversy as to whether the subject matter of a particular section does or does not fall within the exceptions to subsection (b), but absence of such words contains no negative implication since under subsection (b) the general and residual rule is that the effect of all provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code may be varied by agreement.</span>
