                    <span class="" style="">1. The definition of &quot;bank&quot; in subsection (a)(2) includes some institutions that are not commercial banks. The definition reflects the fact that many financial institutions now perform functions previously restricted to commercial banks, including acting on behalf of customers in funds transfers. Since many funds transfers involve payment orders to or from foreign countries the definition also covers foreign banks. The definition also includes Federal Reserve Banks. Funds transfers carried out by Federal Reserve Banks are described in Comments 1 and 2 to Section 4A-107.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">2. Funds transfer business is frequently transacted by banks outside of general banking hours. Thus, the definition of banking day in <a href='/dccode/Title-4/Chapter-1/4-104~P.html'>Section 4-104(1)(c)</a> cannot be used to describe when a bank is open for funds transfer business. Subsection (a)(4) defines a new term, &quot;funds transfer business day,&quot; which is applicable to Article 4A. The definition states, &quot;is open for the receipt, processing, and transmittal of payment orders and cancellations and amendments of payment orders.&quot; In some cases it is possible to electronically transmit payment orders and other communications to a receiving bank at any time. If the receiving bank is not open for the processing of an order when it is received, the communication is stored in the receiving bank&#39;s computer for retrieval when the receiving bank is open for processing. The use of the conjunctive makes clear that the defined term is limited to the period during which all functions of the receiving bank can be performed, i.e., receipt, processing, and transmittal of payment orders, cancellations and amendments.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Subsection (a)(5) defines &quot;funds transfer system.&quot; The term includes a system such as CHIPS which provides for transmission of a payment order as well as settlement of the obligation of the sender to pay the order. It also includes automated clearing houses, operated by a clearing house or other association of banks, which process and transmit payment orders of banks to other banks. In addition the term includes organizations that provide only transmission services such as SWIFT.
