                    <span class="" style="">1. Subsection (a) deals with the problem of payment orders issued to the beneficiary&#39;s bank for payment to nonexistent or unidentifiable persons or accounts. Since it is not possible in that case for the funds transfer to be completed, subsection (a) states that the order cannot be accepted. Under Section 4A-402(c), a sender of a payment order is not obliged to pay its order unless the beneficiary&#39;s bank accepts a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender&#39;s order. Thus, if the beneficiary of a funds transfer is non-existent or unidentifiable, each sender in the funds transfer that has paid its payment order is entitled to get its money back.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (b), which takes precedence over subsection (a), deals with the problem of payment orders in which the description of the beneficiary does not allow identification of the beneficiary because the beneficiary is described by name and by an identifying number or an account number and the name and number refer to different persons. A very large percentage of payment orders issued to the beneficiary&#39;s bank by another bank are processed by automated means using machines capable of reading orders on standard formats that identify the beneficiary by an identifying number or the number of a bank account. The processing of the order by the beneficiary&#39;s bank and the crediting of the beneficiary&#39;s account are done by use of the identifying or bank account number without human reading of the payment order itself. The process is comparable to that used in automated payment of checks. The standard format, however, may also allow the inclusion of the name of the beneficiary and other information which can be useful to the beneficiary&#39;s bank and the beneficiary but which plays no part in the process of payment. If the beneficiary&#39;s bank has both the account number and name of the beneficiary supplied by the originator of the funds transfer, it is possible for the beneficiary&#39;s bank to determine whether the name and number refer to the same person, but if a duty to make that determination is imposed on the beneficiary&#39;s bank the benefits of automated payment are lost. Manual handling of payment orders is both expensive and subject to human error. If payment orders can be handled on an automated basis there are substantial economies of operation and the possibility of clerical error is reduced. Subsection (b) allows banks to utilize automated processing by allowing banks to act on the basis of the number without regard to the name if the bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons. &quot;Know&quot; is defined in Section 1-201(25) to mean actual knowledge, and Section 1-201(27) states rules for determining when an organization has knowledge of information received by the organization. The time of payment is the pertinent time at which knowledge or lack of knowledge must be determined.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">Although the clear trend is for beneficiary&#39;s banks to process payment orders by automated means, Section 4A-207 is not limited to cases in which processing is done by automated means. A bank that processes by semi-automated means or even manually may rely on number as stated in Section 4A-207.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">In cases covered by subsection (b) the erroneous identification would in virtually all cases be the identifying or bank account number. In the typical case the error is made by the originator of the funds transfer. The originator should know the name of the person who is to receive payment and can further identify that person by an address that would normally be known to the originator.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">It is not unlikely, however, that the originator may not be sure whether the identifying or account number refers to the person the originator intends to pay. Subsection (b)(1) deals with the typical case in which the beneficiary&#39;s bank pays on the basis of the account number and is not aware at the time of payment that the named beneficiary is not the holder of the account which was paid. In some cases the false number will be the result of error by the originator. In other cases fraud is involved. For example, Doe is the holder of shares in Mutual Fund. Thief, impersonating Doe, requests redemption of the shares and directs Mutual Fund to wire the redemption proceeds to Doe&#39;s account #12345 in Beneficiary&#39;s Bank. Mutual Fund originates a funds transfer by issuing a payment order to Originator&#39;s Bank to make the payment to Doe&#39;s account #12345 in Beneficiary&#39;s Bank. Originator&#39;s Bank executes the order by issuing a conforming payment order to Beneficiary&#39;s Bank which makes payment to account #12345. That account is the account of Roe rather than Doe. Roe might be a person acting in concert with Thief or Roe might be an innocent third party. Assume that Roe is a gem merchant that agreed to sell gems to Thief who agreed to wire the purchase price to Roe&#39;s account in Beneficiary&#39;s Bank. Roe believed that the credit to Roe&#39;s account was a transfer of funds from Thief and released the gems to Thief in good faith in reliance on the payment. The case law is unclear on the responsibility of a beneficiary&#39;s bank in carrying out a payment order in which the identification of the beneficiary by name and number is conflicting. See Securities Fund Services, Inc. v. American National Bank, 542 F.Supp. 323 (N.D.Ill.1982) and Bradford Trust Co. v. Texas American Bank, 790 F.2d 407 (5th Cir.1986). Section 4A-207 resolves the issue.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">If Beneficiary&#39;s Bank did not know about the conflict between the name and number, subsection (b)(1) applies. Beneficiary&#39;s Bank has no duty to determine whether there is a conflict and it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. When it accepts the order, it is entitled to payment from Originator&#39;s Bank. Section 4A-402(b). On the other hand, if Beneficiary&#39;s Bank knew about the conflict between the name and number and nevertheless paid Roe, subsection (b)(2) applies. Under that provision, acceptance of the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank did not occur because there is no beneficiary of that order. Since acceptance did not occur Originator&#39;s Bank is not obliged to pay Beneficiary&#39;s Bank. Section 4A-402(b). Similarly, Mutual Fund is excused from its obligation to pay Originator&#39;s Bank. Section 4A-402(c). Thus, Beneficiary&#39;s Bank takes the loss. Its only cause of action is against Thief. Roe is not obliged to return the payment to the beneficiary&#39;s bank because Roe received the payment in good faith and for value. Article 4A makes irrelevant the issue of whether Mutual Fund was or was not negligent in issuing its payment order.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Normally, subsection (b)(1) will apply to the hypothetical case discussed in Comment 2. Beneficiary&#39;s Bank will pay on the basis of the number without knowledge of the conflict. In that case subsection (c) places the loss on either Mutual Fund or Originator&#39;s Bank. It is not unfair to assign the loss to Mutual Fund because it is the person who dealt with the impostor and it supplied the wrong account number. It could have avoided the loss if it had not used an account number that it was not sure was that of Doe. Mutual Fund, however, may not have been aware of the risk involved in giving both name and number. Subsection (c) is designed to protect the originator, Mutual Fund, in this case. Under that subsection, the originator is responsible for the inconsistent description of the beneficiary if it had notice that the order might be paid by the beneficiary&#39;s bank on the basis of the number. If the originator is a bank, the originator always has that responsibility. The rationale is that any bank should know how payment orders are processed and paid. If the originator is not a bank, the originator&#39;s bank must prove that its customer, the originator, had notice. Notice can be proved by any admissible evidence, but the bank can always prove notice by providing the customer with a written statement of the required information and obtaining the customer&#39;s signature to the statement. That statement will then apply to any payment order accepted by the bank thereafter. The information need not be supplied more than once.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In the hypothetical case if Originator&#39;s Bank made the disclosure stated in the last sentence of subsection (c)(2), Mutual Fund must pay Originator&#39;s Bank. Under subsection (d)(1), Mutual Fund has an action to recover from Roe if recovery from Roe is permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution. Under the assumed facts Roe should be entitled to keep the money as a person who took it in good faith and for value since it was taken as payment for the gems. In that case, Mutual Fund&#39;s only remedy is against Thief. If Roe was not acting in good faith, Roe has to return the money to Mutual Fund. If Originator&#39;s Bank does not prove that Mutual Fund had notice as stated in subsection (c)(2), Mutual Fund is not required to pay Originator&#39;s Bank. Thus, the risk of loss falls on Originator&#39;s Bank whose remedy is against Roe or Thief as stated above. Subsection (d)(2).</span>
