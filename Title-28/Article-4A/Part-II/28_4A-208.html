                    <span class="" style="">1. This section addresses an issue similar to that addressed by Section 4A-207. Because of automation in the processing of payment orders, a payment order may identify the beneficiary&#39;s bank or an intermediary bank by an identifying number. The bank identified by number might or might not also be identified by name. The following two cases illustrate Section 4A-208(a) and (b):</span>
                
            
        </p>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #1. Originator&#39;s payment order to Originator&#39;s Bank identifies the beneficiary&#39;s bank as Bank A and instructs payment to Account #12345 in that bank. Originator&#39;s Bank executes Originator&#39;s order by issuing a payment order to Intermediary Bank. In the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank the beneficiary&#39;s bank is identified as Bank A but is also identified by number, #67890. The identifying number refers to Bank B rather than Bank A. If processing by Intermediary Bank of the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank is done by automated means, Intermediary Bank, in executing the order, will rely on the identifying number and will issue a payment order to Bank B rather than Bank A. If there is an Account #12345 in Bank B, the payment order of Intermediary Bank would normally be accepted and payment would be made to a person not intended by Originator. In this case, Section 4A-208(b)(1) puts the risk of loss on Originator&#39;s Bank. Intermediary Bank may rely on the number #67890 as the proper identification of the beneficiary&#39;s bank. Intermediary Bank has properly executed the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank. By using the wrong number to describe the beneficiary&#39;s bank, Originator&#39;s Bank has improperly executed Originator&#39;s payment order because the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank provides for payment to the wrong beneficiary, the holder of Account #12345 in Bank B rather than the holder of Account #12345 in Bank A. Section 4A-302(a)(1) and Section 4A-303(c). Originator&#39;s Bank is not entitled to payment from Originator but is required to pay Intermediary Bank. Section 4A-303(c) and Section 4A-402(c). Intermediary Bank is also entitled to compensation for any loss and expenses resulting from the error by Originator&#39;s Bank.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">If there is no Account #12345 in Bank B, the result is that there is no beneficiary of the payment order issued by Originator&#39;s Bank and the funds transfer will not be completed. Originator&#39;s Bank is not entitled to payment from Originator and Intermediary Bank is not entitled to payment from Originator&#39;s Bank. Section 4A-402(c). Since Originator&#39;s Bank improperly executed Originator&#39;s payment order it may be liable for damages under Section 4A-305. As stated above, Intermediary Bank is entitled to compensation for loss and expenses resulting from the error by Originator&#39;s Bank.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #2. Suppose the same payment order by Originator to Originator&#39;s Bank as in Case #1. In executing the payment order Originator&#39;s Bank issues a payment order to Intermediary Bank in which the beneficiary&#39;s bank is identified only by number, #67890.</span>
                
            
        </p>
    
        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">That number does not refer to Bank A. Rather, it identifies a person that is not a bank. If processing by Intermediary Bank of the payment order of Originator&#39;s Bank is done by automated means, Intermediary Bank will rely on the number #67890 to identify the beneficiary&#39;s bank. Intermediary Bank has no duty to determine whether the number identifies a bank. The funds transfer cannot be completed in this case because no bank is identified as the beneficiary&#39;s bank. Subsection (a) puts the risk of loss on Originator&#39;s Bank. Originator&#39;s Bank is not entitled to payment from Originator. Section 4A-402(c). Originator&#39;s Bank has improperly executed Originator&#39;s payment order and may be liable for damages under Section 4A-305. Originator&#39;s Bank is obliged to compensate Intermediary Bank for loss and expenses resulting from the error by Originator&#39;s Bank.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (a) also applies if #67890 identifies a bank, but the bank is not Bank A. Intermediary Bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary&#39;s bank. If the bank to which Intermediary Bank sends its payment order accepts the order, Intermediary Bank is entitled to payment from Originator&#39;s Bank, but Originator&#39;s Bank is not entitled to payment from Originator. The analysis is similar to that in Case #1.</span>

        <p class=" " style="padding-left: 30px">
            
                
                    <span class="" style="">2. Subsection (b)(2) of Section 4A-208 addresses cases in which an erroneous identification of a beneficiary&#39;s bank or intermediary bank by name and number is made in a payment order of a sender that is not a bank. Suppose Originator issues a payment order to Originator&#39;s Bank that instructs that bank to use an intermediary bank identified as Bank A and by an identifying number, #67890. The identifying number refers to Bank B. Originator intended to identify Bank A as intermediary bank. If Originator&#39;s Bank relied on the number and issued a payment order to Bank B the rights of Originator&#39;s Bank depend upon whether the proof of notice stated in subsection (b)(2) is made by Originator&#39;s Bank. If proof is made, Originator&#39;s Bank&#39;s rights are governed by subsection (b)(1) of Section 4A-208. Originator&#39;s Bank is not liable for breach of Section 4A-302(a)(1) and is entitled to compensation from Originator for any loss and expenses resulting from Originator&#39;s error. If notice is not proved, Originator&#39;s Bank may not rely on the number in executing Originator&#39;s payment order. Since Originator&#39;s Bank does not get the benefit of subsection (b)(1) in that case, Originator&#39;s Bank improperly executed Originator&#39;s payment order and is in breach of the obligation stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1). If notice is not given, Originator&#39;s Bank can rely on the name if it is not aware of the conflict in name and number. Subsection (b)(3).</span>
