                    <span class="" style="">2. Section 2A-309(1)(c), which is new, defines purchase money lease to exclude leases where the lessee had possession or use of the goods or the right thereof before the lease agreement became enforceable. This term is used in subsection (4)(a) as one of the conditions that must be satisfied to obtain priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. Section 2A-309(4), which states one of several priority rules found in this section, deletes reference to office machines and the like (<a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(4)(c)</a>) as well as certain liens (<a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(4)(d)</a>). However, these items are included in subsection (5), another priority rule that is more permissive than the rule found in subsection (4) as it applies whether or not the interest of the lessor is perfected. In addition, subsection (5)(a) expands the scope of the provisions of <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(4)(c)</a> to include readily removable equipment not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of real estate; the qualifier is intended to exclude from the expanded rule equipment integral to the operation of real estate, e.g., heating and air conditioning equipment.</span>

The rule stated in subsection (7) is more liberal than the rule stated in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(7)</a> in that issues of priority not otherwise resolved in this subsection are left for resolution by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate, as opposed to the <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(7)</a> automatic subordination of the security interest in fixtures. Note that, for the purpose of this section, where the interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate is paramount to the intent of the lessor, the latter term includes the residual interest of the lessor.</span>

The rule stated in subsection (8) is more liberal than the rule stated in <a href='/dccode/Title-9/Chapter-3/9-313.html'>Section 9-313(8)</a> in that the right of removal is extended to both the lessor and the lessee and the occasion for removal includes expiration, termination or cancellation of the lease agreement, and enforcement of rights and remedies under this Article, as well as default. The new language also provides that upon removal the goods are free and clear of conflicting interests of owners and encumbrancers of the real estate.</span>

Finally, subsection (9) provides a mechanism for the lessor of fixtures to perfect its interest by filing a financing statement under the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9), even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest. Section 1-201(37). The relevant provisions of Article 9 must be interpreted permissively to give effect to this mechanism as it implicitly expands the scope of Article 9 so that its filing provisions apply to transactions that create a lease of fixtures, even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest. This mechanism is similar to that provided in Section 2-326(3)(c) for the seller of goods on consignment, even though the consignment is not &quot;intended as security&quot;. Section 1-201(37). Given the lack of litigation with respect to the mechanism created for consignment sales, this new mechanism should prove effective.</span>
